// Package internetmonitor provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor.
//
// Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor provides visibility into how internet issues
// impact the performance and availability between your applications hosted on
// Amazon Web Services and your end users, reducing the time it takes for you to
// diagnose these issues, from days to minutes. You can explore internet
// measurements for different time frames and at different geographic
// granularities, and quickly visualize the impact of issues, and then take action
// to improve your end users' experience, for example, by switching to other Amazon
// Web Services services or rerouting traffic to your workload through
// differentAmazon Web Services Regions. If the issue is caused by the Amazon Web
// Services network, you'll automatically receive an Amazon Web Services Health
// Dashboard notification with the steps that Amazon Web Services is taking to
// mitigate the problem. To support integrating health information for geographies
// and networks specific to your application, Internet Monitor delivers
// measurements to CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Metrics. Internet Monitor also
// sends health events to Amazon EventBridge, so you can set up notifications.
// Internet Monitor monitors internet connectivity for your application through
// Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), Amazon CloudFront distributions, and
// Amazon WorkSpaces directories. To use Internet Monitor, you create a monitor and
// add resources to it, Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), Amazon CloudFront
// distributions, or WorkSpaces directories that show where your application's
// internet traffic is. Internet Monitor then provides internet measurements from
// Amazon Web Services that are specific to the locations and networks that
// communicate with your application. For more information, see Using Amazon
// CloudWatch Internet Monitor (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-InternetMonitor.html)
// in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
