// Measurements about the availability for your application on the internet,
// calculated by Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor. Amazon Web Services has
// substantial historical data about internet performance and availability between
// Amazon Web Services services and different network providers and geographies. By
// applying statistical analysis to the data, Internet Monitor can detect when the
// performance and availability for your application has dropped, compared to an
// estimated baseline that's already calculated. To make it easier to see those
// drops, we report that information to you in the form of health scores: a
// performance score and an availability score. Availability in Internet Monitor
// represents the estimated percentage of traffic that is not seeing an
// availability drop. For example, an availability score of 99% for an end user and
// service location pair is equivalent to 1% of the traffic experiencing an
// availability drop for that pair. For more information, see  How Internet Monitor
// calculates performance and availability scores
