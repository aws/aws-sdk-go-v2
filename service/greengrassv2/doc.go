// Package greengrassv2 provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS IoT Greengrass V2.
//
// AWS IoT Greengrass brings local compute, messaging, data management, sync, and
// ML inference capabilities to edge devices. This enables devices to collect and
// analyze data closer to the source of information, react autonomously to local
// events, and communicate securely with each other on local networks. Local
// devices can also communicate securely with AWS IoT Core and export IoT data to
// the AWS Cloud. AWS IoT Greengrass developers can use AWS Lambda functions and
// components to create and deploy applications to fleets of edge devices for local
// operation. AWS IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version of the AWS
// IoT Greengrass Core software, new APIs, and a new console. Use this API
// reference to learn how to use the AWS IoT Greengrass V2 API operations to manage
// components, manage deployments, and core devices. For more information, see What
// is AWS IoT Greengrass?
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/what-is-iot-greengrass.html)
// in the AWS IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide.
