// Package iotwireless provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS IoT Wireless.
//
// AWS IoT Wireless provides bi-directional communication between
// internet-connected wireless devices and the AWS Cloud. To onboard both LoRaWAN
// and Sidewalk devices to AWS IoT, use the IoT Wireless API. These wireless
// devices use the Low Power Wide Area Networking (LPWAN) communication protocol to
// communicate with AWS IoT. Using the API, you can perform create, read, update,
// and delete operations for your wireless devices, gateways, destinations, and
// profiles. After onboarding your devices, you can use the API operations to set
// log levels and monitor your devices with CloudWatch. You can also use the API
// operations to create multicast groups and schedule a multicast session for
// sending a downlink message to devices in the group. By using Firmware Updates
// Over-The-Air (FUOTA) API operations, you can create a FUOTA task and schedule a
// session to update the firmware of individual devices or an entire group of
// devices in a multicast group.
