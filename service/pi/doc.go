// Package pi provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Performance Insights.
//
// AWS Performance Insights enables you to monitor and explore different dimensions
// of database load based on data captured from a running RDS instance. The guide
// provides detailed information about Performance Insights data types, parameters
// and errors. For more information about Performance Insights capabilities see
// Using Amazon RDS Performance Insights
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.html)
// in the Amazon RDS User Guide. The AWS Performance Insights API provides
// visibility into the performance of your RDS instance, when Performance Insights
// is enabled for supported engine types. While Amazon CloudWatch provides the
// authoritative source for AWS service vended monitoring metrics, AWS Performance
// Insights offers a domain-specific view of database load measured as Average
// Active Sessions and provided to API consumers as a 2-dimensional time-series
// dataset. The time dimension of the data provides DB load data for each time
// point in the queried time range, and each time point decomposes overall load in
// relation to the requested dimensions, such as SQL, Wait-event, User or Host,
// measured at that time point.
