// AWS Global Accelerator This is the AWS Global Accelerator API Reference. This
// guide is for developers who need detailed information about AWS Global
// Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about
// Global Accelerator features, see the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/Welcome.html). AWS
// Global Accelerator is a service in which you create accelerators to improve
// availability and performance of your applications for local and global users.
// <important> <p>You must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to create or update
// accelerators.</p> </important> <p>By default, Global Accelerator provides you
// with static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator. (Instead of
// using the IP addresses that Global Accelerator provides, you can configure these
// entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges that you bring
// to Global Accelerator.) The static IP addresses are anycast from the AWS edge
// network and distribute incoming application traffic across multiple endpoint
// resources in multiple AWS Regions, which increases the availability of your
// applications. Endpoints can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load
// Balancers, EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located in one AWS
// Region or multiple Regions.</p> <p>Global Accelerator uses the AWS global
// network to route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based on health,
// client location, and policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly
// to changes in health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic from
// clients is directed to only healthy endpoints.</p> <p>Global Accelerator
// includes components that work together to help you improve performance and
// availability for your applications:</p> <dl> <dt>Static IP address</dt> <dd>
// <p>By default, AWS Global Accelerator provides you with a set of static IP
// addresses that are anycast from the AWS edge network and serve as the single
// fixed entry points for your clients. Or you can configure these entry points to
// be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges that you bring to Global
// Accelerator (BYOIP). For more information, see <a
// href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/using-byoip.html">Bring
// Your Own IP Addresses (BYOIP)</a> in the <i>AWS Global Accelerator Developer
// Guide</i>. If you already have load balancers, EC2 instances, or Elastic IP
// addresses set up for your applications, you can easily add those to Global
// Accelerator to allow the resources to be accessed by the static IP
// addresses.</p> <important> <p>The static IP addresses remain assigned to your
// accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it
// no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you <i>delete</i> an
// accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you
// can no longer route traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies with Global
// Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator.
// For more information, see <a
// href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/auth-and-access-control.html">Authentication
// and Access Control</a> in the <i>AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide</i>.
// </p> </important> </dd> <dt>Accelerator</dt> <dd> <p>An accelerator directs
// traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network to improve availability
// and performance for your internet applications that have a global audience. Each
// accelerator includes one or more listeners.</p> </dd> <dt>DNS name</dt> <dd>
// <p>Global Accelerator assigns each accelerator a default Domain Name System
// (DNS) name, similar to <code>a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com</code>,
// that points to your Global Accelerator static IP addresses. Depending on the use
// case, you can use your accelerator's static IP addresses or DNS name to route
// traffic to your accelerator, or set up DNS records to route traffic using your
// own custom domain name.</p> </dd> <dt>Network zone</dt> <dd> <p>A network zone
// services the static IP addresses for your accelerator from a unique IP subnet.
// Similar to an AWS Availability Zone, a network zone is an isolated unit with its
// own set of physical infrastructure. When you configure an accelerator, by
// default, Global Accelerator allocates two IPv4 addresses for it. If one IP
// address from a network zone becomes unavailable due to IP address blocking by
// certain client networks, or network disruptions, then client applications can
// retry on the healthy static IP address from the other isolated network zone.</p>
// </dd> <dt>Listener</dt> <dd> <p>A listener processes inbound connections from
// clients to Global Accelerator, based on the protocol and port that you
// configure. Each listener has one or more endpoint groups associated with it, and
// traffic is forwarded to endpoints in one of the groups. You associate endpoint
// groups with listeners by specifying the Regions that you want to distribute
// traffic to. Traffic is distributed to optimal endpoints within the endpoint
// groups associated with a listener.</p> </dd> <dt>Endpoint group</dt> <dd>
// <p>Each endpoint group is associated with a specific AWS Region. Endpoint groups
// include one or more endpoints in the Region. You can increase or reduce the
// percentage of traffic that would be otherwise directed to an endpoint group by
// adjusting a setting called a <i>traffic dial</i>. The traffic dial lets you
// easily do performance testing or blue/green deployment testing for new releases
// across different AWS Regions, for example. </p> </dd> <dt>Endpoint</dt> <dd>
// <p>An endpoint is a Network Load Balancer, Application Load Balancer, EC2
// instance, or Elastic IP address. Traffic is routed to endpoints based on several
// factors, including the geo-proximity to the user, the health of the endpoint,
// and the configuration options that you choose, such as endpoint weights. For
// each endpoint, you can configure weights, which are numbers that you can use to
// specify the proportion of traffic to route to each one. This can be useful, for
// example, to do performance testing within a Region.</p> </dd> </dl>
