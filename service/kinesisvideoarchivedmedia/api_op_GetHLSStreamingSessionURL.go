type GetHLSStreamingSessionURLInput struct {
	_ struct{} `type:"structure"`

	// Specifies which format should be used for packaging the media. Specifying
	// the FRAGMENTED_MP4 container format packages the media into MP4 fragments
	// (fMP4 or CMAF). This is the recommended packaging because there is minimal
	// packaging overhead. The other container format option is MPEG_TS. HLS has
	// supported MPEG TS chunks since it was released and is sometimes the only
	// supported packaging on older HLS players. MPEG TS typically has a 5-25 percent
	// packaging overhead. This means MPEG TS typically requires 5-25 percent more
	// bandwidth and cost than fMP4.
	//
	// The default is FRAGMENTED_MP4.
	ContainerFormat ContainerFormat `type:"string" enum:"true"`

	// Specifies when flags marking discontinuities between fragments are added
	// to the media playlists.
	//
	// Media players typically build a timeline of media content to play, based
	// on the timestamps of each fragment. This means that if there is any overlap
	// or gap between fragments (as is typical if HLSFragmentSelector is set to
	// SERVER_TIMESTAMP), the media player timeline will also have small gaps between
	// fragments in some places, and will overwrite frames in other places. Gaps
	// in the media player timeline can cause playback to stall and overlaps can
	// cause playback to be jittery. When there are discontinuity flags between
	// fragments, the media player is expected to reset the timeline, resulting
	// in the next fragment being played immediately after the previous fragment.
	//
	// The following modes are supported:
	//
	//    * ALWAYS: a discontinuity marker is placed between every fragment in the
	//    HLS media playlist. It is recommended to use a value of ALWAYS if the
	//    fragment timestamps are not accurate.
	//
	//    * NEVER: no discontinuity markers are placed anywhere. It is recommended
	//    to use a value of NEVER to ensure the media player timeline most accurately
	//    maps to the producer timestamps.
	//
	//    * ON_DISCONTIUNITY: a discontinuity marker is placed between fragments
	//    that have a gap or overlap of more than 50 milliseconds. For most playback
	//    scenarios, it is recommended to use a value of ON_DISCONTINUITY so that
	//    the media player timeline is only reset when there is a significant issue
	//    with the media timeline (e.g. a missing fragment).
	//
	// The default is ALWAYS when HLSFragmentSelector is set to SERVER_TIMESTAMP,
	// and NEVER when it is set to PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP.
	DiscontinuityMode HLSDiscontinuityMode `type:"string" enum:"true"`

	// Specifies when the fragment start timestamps should be included in the HLS
	// media playlist. Typically, media players report the playhead position as
	// a time relative to the start of the first fragment in the playback session.
	// However, when the start timestamps are included in the HLS media playlist,
	// some media players might report the current playhead as an absolute time
	// based on the fragment timestamps. This can be useful for creating a playback
	// experience that shows viewers the wall-clock time of the media.
	//
	// The default is NEVER. When HLSFragmentSelector is SERVER_TIMESTAMP, the timestamps
	// will be the server start timestamps. Similarly, when HLSFragmentSelector
	// is PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP, the timestamps will be the producer start timestamps.
	DisplayFragmentTimestamp HLSDisplayFragmentTimestamp `type:"string" enum:"true"`

	// The time in seconds until the requested session expires. This value can be
	// between 300 (5 minutes) and 43200 (12 hours).
	//
	// When a session expires, no new calls to GetHLSMasterPlaylist, GetHLSMediaPlaylist,
	// GetMP4InitFragment, GetMP4MediaFragment, or GetTSFragment can be made for
	// that session.
	//
	// The default is 300 (5 minutes).
	Expires *int64 `min:"300" type:"integer"`

	// The time range of the requested fragment and the source of the timestamps.
	//
	// This parameter is required if PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND or LIVE_REPLAY. This
	// parameter is optional if PlaybackMode is LIVE. If PlaybackMode is LIVE, the
	// FragmentSelectorType can be set, but the TimestampRange should not be set.
	// If PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND or LIVE_REPLAY, both FragmentSelectorType and
	// TimestampRange must be set.
	HLSFragmentSelector *HLSFragmentSelector `type:"structure"`

	// The maximum number of fragments that are returned in the HLS media playlists.
	//
	// When the PlaybackMode is LIVE, the most recent fragments are returned up
	// to this value. When the PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND, the oldest fragments are
	// returned, up to this maximum number.
	//
	// When there are a higher number of fragments available in a live HLS media
	// playlist, video players often buffer content before starting playback. Increasing
	// the buffer size increases the playback latency, but it decreases the likelihood
	// that rebuffering will occur during playback. We recommend that a live HLS
	// media playlist have a minimum of 3 fragments and a maximum of 10 fragments.
	//
	// The default is 5 fragments if PlaybackMode is LIVE or LIVE_REPLAY, and 1,000
	// if PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND.
	//
	// The maximum value of 1,000 fragments corresponds to more than 16 minutes
	// of video on streams with 1-second fragments, and more than 2 1/2 hours of
	// video on streams with 10-second fragments.
	MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults *int64 `min:"1" type:"long"`

	// Whether to retrieve live, live replay, or archived, on-demand data.
	//
	// Features of the three types of sessions include the following:
	//
	//    * LIVE : For sessions of this type, the HLS media playlist is continually
	//    updated with the latest fragments as they become available. We recommend
	//    that the media player retrieve a new playlist on a one-second interval.
	//    When this type of session is played in a media player, the user interface
	//    typically displays a "live" notification, with no scrubber control for
	//    choosing the position in the playback window to display. In LIVE mode,
	//    the newest available fragments are included in an HLS media playlist,
	//    even if there is a gap between fragments (that is, if a fragment is missing).
	//    A gap like this might cause a media player to halt or cause a jump in
	//    playback. In this mode, fragments are not added to the HLS media playlist
	//    if they are older than the newest fragment in the playlist. If the missing
	//    fragment becomes available after a subsequent fragment is added to the
	//    playlist, the older fragment is not added, and the gap is not filled.
	//
	//    * LIVE_REPLAY : For sessions of this type, the HLS media playlist is updated
	//    similarly to how it is updated for LIVE mode except that it starts by
	//    including fragments from a given start time. Instead of fragments being
	//    added as they are ingested, fragments are added as the duration of the
	//    next fragment elapses. For example, if the fragments in the session are
	//    two seconds long, then a new fragment is added to the media playlist every
	//    two seconds. This mode is useful to be able to start playback from when
	//    an event is detected and continue live streaming media that has not yet
	//    been ingested as of the time of the session creation. This mode is also
	//    useful to stream previously archived media without being limited by the
	//    1,000 fragment limit in the ON_DEMAND mode.
	//
	//    * ON_DEMAND : For sessions of this type, the HLS media playlist contains
	//    all the fragments for the session, up to the number that is specified
	//    in MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults. The playlist must be retrieved only
	//    once for each session. When this type of session is played in a media
	//    player, the user interface typically displays a scrubber control for choosing
	//    the position in the playback window to display.
	//
	// In all playback modes, if FragmentSelectorType is PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP, and
	// if there are multiple fragments with the same start timestamp, the fragment
	// that has the larger fragment number (that is, the newer fragment) is included
	// in the HLS media playlist. The other fragments are not included. Fragments
	// that have different timestamps but have overlapping durations are still included
	// in the HLS media playlist. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the media
	// player.
	//
	// The default is LIVE.

// GetHLSStreamingSessionURLRequest returns a request value for making API operation for

//
// Retrieves an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) URL for the stream. You can then open
// the URL in a browser or media player to view the stream contents.
//
// Both the StreamName and the StreamARN parameters are optional, but you must
// specify either the StreamName or the StreamARN when invoking this API operation.
//
// An Amazon Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for providing
// data through HLS:
//
//    * The media must contain h.264 or h.265 encoded video and, optionally,
//    AAC encoded audio. Specifically, the codec ID of track 1 should be V_MPEG/ISO/AVC
//    (for h.264) or V_MPEG/ISO/HEVC (for h.265). Optionally, the codec ID of
//    track 2 should be A_AAC.
//
//    * Data retention must be greater than 0.
//
//    * The video track of each fragment must contain codec private data in
//    the Advanced Video Coding (AVC) for H.264 format or HEVC for H.265 format
//    (MPEG-4 specification ISO/IEC 14496-15 (https://www.iso.org/standard/55980.html)).
//    For information about adapting stream data to a given format, see NAL
//    Adaptation Flags (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/producer-reference-nal.html).
//
//    * The audio track (if present) of each fragment must contain codec private
//    data in the AAC format (AAC specification ISO/IEC 13818-7 (https://www.iso.org/standard/43345.html)).
//
// Kinesis Video Streams HLS sessions contain fragments in the fragmented MPEG-4
// form (also called fMP4 or CMAF) or the MPEG-2 form (also called TS chunks,
// which the HLS specification also supports). For more information about HLS
// fragment types, see the HLS specification (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-23).
//
// The following procedure shows how to use HLS with Kinesis Video Streams:
//
// Get an endpoint using GetDataEndpoint (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/API_GetDataEndpoint.html),
// specifying GET_HLS_STREAMING_SESSION_URL for the APIName parameter.
//
// Retrieve the HLS URL using GetHLSStreamingSessionURL. Kinesis Video Streams
// creates an HLS streaming session to be used for accessing content in a stream
// using the HLS protocol. GetHLSStreamingSessionURL returns an authenticated
// URL (that includes an encrypted session token) for the session's HLS master
// playlist (the root resource needed for streaming with HLS).
//
// Don't share or store this token where an unauthorized entity could access
// it. The token provides access to the content of the stream. Safeguard the
// token with the same measures that you would use with your AWS credentials.
//
// The media that is made available through the playlist consists only of the
// requested stream, time range, and format. No other media data (such as frames
// outside the requested window or alternate bitrates) is made available.
//
// Provide the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for the HLS master
// playlist to a media player that supports the HLS protocol. Kinesis Video
// Streams makes the HLS media playlist, initialization fragment, and media
// fragments available through the master playlist URL. The initialization fragment
// contains the codec private data for the stream, and other data needed to
// set up the video or audio decoder and renderer. The media fragments contain
// H.264-encoded video frames or AAC-encoded audio samples.
//
// The media player receives the authenticated URL and requests stream metadata
// and media data normally. When the media player requests data, it calls the
// following actions:
//
//    * GetHLSMasterPlaylist: Retrieves an HLS master playlist, which contains
//    a URL for the GetHLSMediaPlaylist action for each track, and additional
//    metadata for the media player, including estimated bitrate and resolution.
//
//    * GetHLSMediaPlaylist: Retrieves an HLS media playlist, which contains
//    a URL to access the MP4 initialization fragment with the GetMP4InitFragment
//    action, and URLs to access the MP4 media fragments with the GetMP4MediaFragment
//    actions. The HLS media playlist also contains metadata about the stream
//    that the player needs to play it, such as whether the PlaybackMode is
//    LIVE or ON_DEMAND. The HLS media playlist is typically static for sessions
//    with a PlaybackType of ON_DEMAND. The HLS media playlist is continually
//    updated with new fragments for sessions with a PlaybackType of LIVE. There
//    is a distinct HLS media playlist for the video track and the audio track
//    (if applicable) that contains MP4 media URLs for the specific track.
//
//    * GetMP4InitFragment: Retrieves the MP4 initialization fragment. The media
//    player typically loads the initialization fragment before loading any
//    media fragments. This fragment contains the "fytp" and "moov" MP4 atoms,
//    and the child atoms that are needed to initialize the media player decoder.
//    The initialization fragment does not correspond to a fragment in a Kinesis
//    video stream. It contains only the codec private data for the stream and
//    respective track, which the media player needs to decode the media frames.
//
//    * GetMP4MediaFragment: Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These fragments
//    contain the "moof" and "mdat" MP4 atoms and their child atoms, containing
//    the encoded fragment's media frames and their timestamps. After the first
//    media fragment is made available in a streaming session, any fragments
//    that don't contain the same codec private data cause an error to be returned
//    when those different media fragments are loaded. Therefore, the codec
//    private data should not change between fragments in a session. This also
//    means that the session fails if the fragments in a stream change from
//    having only video to having both audio and video. Data retrieved with
//    this action is billable. See Pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/pricing/)
//    for details.
//
//    * GetTSFragment: Retrieves MPEG TS fragments containing both initialization
//    and media data for all tracks in the stream. If the ContainerFormat is
//    MPEG_TS, this API is used instead of GetMP4InitFragment and GetMP4MediaFragment
//    to retrieve stream media. Data retrieved with this action is billable.
//    For more information, see Kinesis Video Streams pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/pricing/).
//
// The following restrictions apply to HLS sessions:
//
//    * A streaming session URL should not be shared between players. The service
//    might throttle a session if multiple media players are sharing it. For
//    connection limits, see Kinesis Video Streams Limits (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/limits.html).
//
//    * A Kinesis video stream can have a maximum of ten active HLS streaming
//    sessions. If a new session is created when the maximum number of sessions
//    is already active, the oldest (earliest created) session is closed. The
//    number of active GetMedia connections on a Kinesis video stream does not
//    count against this limit, and the number of active HLS sessions does not
//    count against the active GetMedia connection limit. The maximum limits
//    for active HLS and MPEG-DASH streaming sessions are independent of each
//    other.
//
// You can monitor the amount of data that the media player consumes by monitoring
// the GetMP4MediaFragment.OutgoingBytes Amazon CloudWatch metric. For information
