	// The maximum operating resources that this rule group can use. Rule group
	// capacity is fixed at creation. When you update a rule group, you are limited to
	// this capacity. When you reference a rule group from a firewall policy, Network
	// Firewall reserves this capacity for the rule group. You can retrieve the
	// capacity that would be required for a rule group before you create the rule
	// group by calling CreateRuleGroup with DryRun set to TRUE. You can't change or
	// exceed this capacity when you update the rule group, so leave room for your rule
	// group to grow. Capacity for a stateless rule group For a stateless rule group,
	// the capacity required is the sum of the capacity requirements of the individual
	// rules that you expect to have in the rule group. To calculate the capacity
	// requirement of a single rule, multiply the capacity requirement values of each
	// of the rule's match settings:
	//
	// * A match setting with no criteria specified has
	// a value of 1.
	//
	// * A match setting with Any specified has a value of 1.
	//
	// * All
	// other match settings have a value equal to the number of elements provided in
	// the setting. For example, a protocol setting ["UDP"] and a source setting
	// ["10.0.0.0/24"] each have a value of 1. A protocol setting ["UDP","TCP"] has a
	// value of 2. A source setting ["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"] has a
	// value of 3.
	//
	// A rule with no criteria specified in any of its match settings has
	// a capacity requirement of 1. A rule with protocol setting ["UDP","TCP"], source
	// setting ["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"], and a single specification
	// or no specification for each of the other match settings has a capacity
	// requirement of 6. Capacity for a stateful rule group For a stateful rule group,
	// the minimum capacity required is the number of individual rules that you expect
	// to have in the rule group.

	// Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to just check the validity of the

	// whether the request can run successfully, but doesn't actually make the
	// requested changes. The call returns the value that the request would return if
	// you ran it with dry run set to FALSE, but doesn't make additions or changes to
	// your resources. This option allows you to make sure that you have the required
	// permissions to run the request and that your request parameters are valid. If
	// set to FALSE, Network Firewall makes the requested changes to your resources.

	// populated RuleGroup setting, but not both. You can provide your rule group
	// specification in a file through this setting when you create or update your rule
	// group. The call response returns a RuleGroup object that Network Firewall has
	// populated from your file. Network Firewall uses the file contents to populate
	// the rule group rules, but does not maintain a reference to the file or use the
	// file in any way after performing the create or update. If you call
	// DescribeRuleGroup to retrieve the rule group, Network Firewall returns rules
	// settings inside a RuleGroup object.

	// A token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to your
	// requests that access the rule group. The token marks the state of the rule group
	// resource at the time of the request. To make changes to the rule group, you
	// provide the token in your request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure
	// that the rule group hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has
	// changed, the operation fails with an InvalidTokenException. If this happens,
