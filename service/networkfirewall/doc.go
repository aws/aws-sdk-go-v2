// Package networkfirewall provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for AWS Network Firewall.
//
// This is the API Reference for Network Firewall. This guide is for developers
// who need detailed information about the Network Firewall API actions, data
// types, and errors.
//   - The REST API requires you to handle connection details, such as calculating
//     signatures, handling request retries, and error handling. For general
//     information about using the Amazon Web Services REST APIs, see Amazon Web
//     Services APIs (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-apis.html) .
//     To access Network Firewall using the REST API endpoint:
//     https://network-firewall..amazonaws.com
//   - Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an
//     API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using.
//     For more information, see Amazon Web Services SDKs (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs)
//     .
//   - For descriptions of Network Firewall features, including and step-by-step
//     instructions on how to use them through the Network Firewall console, see the
//     Network Firewall Developer Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/)
//     .
//
// Network Firewall is a stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion
// detection and prevention service for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).
// With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This
// includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT
// gateway, or over VPN or Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses rules that are
// compatible with Suricata, a free, open source network analysis and threat
// detection engine. Network Firewall supports Suricata version 6.0.9. For
// information about Suricata, see the Suricata website (https://suricata.io/) .
// You can use Network Firewall to monitor and protect your VPC traffic in a number
// of ways. The following are just a few examples:
//   - Allow domains or IP addresses for known Amazon Web Services service
//     endpoints, such as Amazon S3, and block all other forms of traffic.
//   - Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain names
//     that your applications can access.
//   - Perform deep packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your VPC.
//   - Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS, regardless
//     of the port used.
//
// To enable Network Firewall for your VPCs, you perform steps in both Amazon VPC
// and in Network Firewall. For information about using Amazon VPC, see Amazon VPC
// User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/) . To start using
// Network Firewall, do the following:
//   - (Optional) If you don't already have a VPC that you want to protect, create
//     it in Amazon VPC.
//   - In Amazon VPC, in each Availability Zone where you want to have a firewall
//     endpoint, create a subnet for the sole use of Network Firewall.
//   - In Network Firewall, create stateless and stateful rule groups, to define
//     the components of the network traffic filtering behavior that you want your
//     firewall to have.
//   - In Network Firewall, create a firewall policy that uses your rule groups
//     and specifies additional default traffic filtering behavior.
//   - In Network Firewall, create a firewall and specify your new firewall policy
//     and VPC subnets. Network Firewall creates a firewall endpoint in each subnet
//     that you specify, with the behavior that's defined in the firewall policy.
//   - In Amazon VPC, use ingress routing enhancements to route traffic through
//     the new firewall endpoints.
