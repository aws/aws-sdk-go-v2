	// MULTIVALUE If you define a health check for the service and the health check is
	// healthy, Route 53 returns the applicable value for up to eight instances. For
	// example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A record and a
	// health check, and you use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53
	// responds to DNS queries with IP addresses for up to eight healthy instances. If
	// fewer than eight instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to every DNS query
	// with the IP addresses for all of the healthy instances. If you don't define a

	// and returns the values for up to eight instances. For more information about the
	// multivalue routing policy, see Multivalue Answer Routing
	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-multivalue)
	// in the Route 53 Developer Guide. WEIGHTED Route 53 returns the applicable value
	// from one randomly selected instance from among the instances that you registered
	// using the same service. Currently, all records have the same weight, so you

// Public DNS and HTTP namespaces only. A complex type that contains settings for
// an optional health check. If you specify settings for a health check, AWS Cloud
// Map associates the health check with the records that you specify in DnsConfig.
// If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either
// HealthCheckCustomConfig or HealthCheckConfig but not both. Health checks are
// basic Route 53 health checks that monitor an AWS endpoint. For information about
// pricing for health checks, see Amazon Route 53 Pricing
// (http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/). Note the following about configuring
// health checks. A and AAAA records If DnsConfig includes configurations for both
// A and AAAA records, AWS Cloud Map creates a health check that uses the IPv4
// address to check the health of the resource. If the endpoint that is specified
// by the IPv4 address is unhealthy, Route 53 considers both the A and AAAA records
// to be unhealthy. CNAME records You can't specify settings for HealthCheckConfig
// when the DNSConfig includes CNAME for the value of Type. If you do, the
// CreateService request will fail with an InvalidInput error. Request interval A
// Route 53 health checker in each health-checking region sends a health check
// request to an endpoint every 30 seconds. On average, your endpoint receives a
// health check request about every two seconds. However, health checkers don't
// coordinate with one another, so you'll sometimes see several requests per second
// followed by a few seconds with no health checks at all. Health checking regions
// Health checkers perform checks from all Route 53 health-checking regions. For a
// list of the current regions, see Regions
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_HealthCheckConfig.html#Route53-Type-HealthCheckConfig-Regions).
// Alias records When you register an instance, if you include the
// AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME attribute, AWS Cloud Map creates a Route 53 alias record.
// Note the following:
//
// * Route 53 automatically sets EvaluateTargetHealth to true
// for alias records. When EvaluateTargetHealth is true, the alias record inherits
// the health of the referenced AWS resource. such as an ELB load balancer. For
// more information, see EvaluateTargetHealth
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_AliasTarget.html#Route53-Type-AliasTarget-EvaluateTargetHealth).
//
// *
// If you include HealthCheckConfig and then use the service to register an

// check.

	// The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Route 53
	// determines whether an endpoint is healthy. You can't change the value of Type

	// checks:
	//
	// * HTTP: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful,
	// Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or
	// greater and less than 400.
	//
	// * HTTPS: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP
	// connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an
	// HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. If you specify HTTPS for
	// the value of Type, the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or later.
	//
	// * TCP: Route 53

// A complex type that contains information about an optional custom health check.
// A custom health check, which requires that you use a third-party health checker
// to evaluate the health of your resources, is useful in the following
// circumstances:
//
// * You can't use a health check that is defined by
// HealthCheckConfig because the resource isn't available over the internet. For
// example, you can use a custom health check when the instance is in an Amazon
// VPC. (To check the health of resources in a VPC, the health checker must also be
// in the VPC.)
//
// * You want to use a third-party health checker regardless of where
// your resources are.
//
// If you specify a health check configuration, you can
// specify either HealthCheckCustomConfig or HealthCheckConfig but not both. To
// change the status of a custom health check, submit an
// UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus request. AWS Cloud Map doesn't monitor the
// status of the resource, it just keeps a record of the status specified in the
// most recent UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus request. Here's how custom health
// checks work:
//
// * You create a service and specify a value for FailureThreshold.
// The failure threshold indicates the number of 30-second intervals you want AWS
// Cloud Map to wait between the time that your application sends an
// UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus.html)

// * You register an instance.
//
// * You configure a
// third-party health checker to monitor the resource that is associated with the
// new instance. AWS Cloud Map doesn't check the health of the resource
// directly.
//
// * The third-party health-checker determines that the resource is
// unhealthy and notifies your application.
//
// * Your application submits an
// UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus request.
//
// * AWS Cloud Map waits for
// (FailureThreshold x 30) seconds.
//
// * If another UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus

	// circumstances:
	//
	// * You can't use a health check that is defined by
	// HealthCheckConfig because the resource isn't available over the internet. For
	// example, you can use a custom health check when the instance is in an Amazon
	// VPC. (To check the health of resources in a VPC, the health checker must also be
	// in the VPC.)
	//
	// * You want to use a third-party health checker regardless of where
	// your resources are.
	//
	// If you specify a health check configuration, you can
	// specify either HealthCheckCustomConfig or HealthCheckConfig but not both. To
	// change the status of a custom health check, submit an
	// UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus request. AWS Cloud Map doesn't monitor the
	// status of the resource, it just keeps a record of the status specified in the
	// most recent UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus request. Here's how custom health
	// checks work:
	//
	// * You create a service and specify a value for FailureThreshold.
	// The failure threshold indicates the number of 30-second intervals you want AWS
	// Cloud Map to wait between the time that your application sends an

	// request and the time that AWS Cloud Map stops routing internet traffic to the
	// corresponding resource.
	//
	// * You register an instance.
	//
	// * You configure a
	// third-party health checker to monitor the resource that is associated with the
	// new instance. AWS Cloud Map doesn't check the health of the resource
	// directly.
	//
	// * The third-party health-checker determines that the resource is
	// unhealthy and notifies your application.
	//
	// * Your application submits an
	// UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus request.
	//
	// * AWS Cloud Map waits for
	// (FailureThreshold x 30) seconds.
	//
	// * If another UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus
	// request doesn't arrive during that time to change the status back to healthy,
