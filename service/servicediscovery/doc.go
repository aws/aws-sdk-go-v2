// Package servicediscovery provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for AWS Cloud Map.
//
// AWS Cloud Map lets you configure public DNS, private DNS, or HTTP namespaces
// that your microservice applications run in. When an instance of the service
// becomes available, you can call the AWS Cloud Map API to register the instance
// with AWS Cloud Map. For public or private DNS namespaces, AWS Cloud Map
// automatically creates DNS records and an optional health check. Clients that
// submit public or private DNS queries, or HTTP requests, for the service receive
// an answer that contains up to eight healthy records.
