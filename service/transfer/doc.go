// Amazon Web Services Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the
// transfer of files over the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer Protocol
// over SSL (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly
// into and out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Amazon Web Services
// helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to Amazon Web Services
// Transfer Family by integrating with existing authentication systems, and
// providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes for your customers
// and partners, or their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can use it
// with Amazon Web Services services for processing, analytics, machine learning,
// and archiving. Getting started with Amazon Web Services Transfer Family is easy
// since there is no infrastructure to buy and set up.
