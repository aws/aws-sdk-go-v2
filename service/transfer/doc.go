// AWS Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of
// files over the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer Protocol over SSL
// (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly into and
// out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). AWS helps you seamlessly
// migrate your file transfer workflows to AWS Transfer Family by integrating with
// existing authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53
// so nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their applications. With
// your data in Amazon S3, you can use it with AWS services for processing,
// analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with AWS Transfer
// Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to buy and set up.
