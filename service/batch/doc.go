// Package batch provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Batch.
//
// Using AWS Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch
// computing is a common means for developers, scientists, and engineers to access
// large amounts of compute resources. AWS Batch uses the advantages of this
// computing workload to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring
// and managing required infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a
// familiar batch computing software approach. Given these advantages, AWS Batch
// can help you to efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted,
// thus effectively helping you to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute
// costs, and deliver your results more quickly. As a fully managed service, AWS
// Batch can run batch computing workloads of any scale. AWS Batch automatically
// provisions compute resources and optimizes workload distribution based on the
// quantity and scale of your specific workloads. With AWS Batch, there's no need
// to install or manage batch computing software. This means that you can focus
// your time and energy on analyzing results and solving your specific problems.
