// Package batch provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Batch.
//
// AWS Batch enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch
// computing is a common way for developers, scientists, and engineers to access
// large amounts of compute resources, and AWS Batch removes the undifferentiated
// heavy lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure. AWS Batch
// will be familiar to users of traditional batch computing software. This service
// can efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted in order to
// eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver results
// quickly. As a fully managed service, AWS Batch enables developers, scientists,
// and engineers to run batch computing workloads of any scale. AWS Batch
// automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes the workload
// distribution based on the quantity and scale of the workloads. With AWS Batch,
// there is no need to install or manage batch computing software, which allows you
// to focus on analyzing results and solving problems. AWS Batch reduces
// operational complexities, saves time, and reduces costs, which makes it easy for
// developers, scientists, and engineers to run their batch jobs in the AWS Cloud.
