// Package batch provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Batch.
//
// Batch Using Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the Amazon Web
// Services Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for developers, scientists,
// and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. Batch uses the
// advantages of this computing workload to remove the undifferentiated heavy
// lifting of configuring and managing required infrastructure. At the same time,
// it also adopts a familiar batch computing software approach. Given these
// advantages, Batch can help you to efficiently provision resources in response to
// jobs submitted, thus effectively helping you to eliminate capacity constraints,
// reduce compute costs, and deliver your results more quickly. As a fully managed
// service, Batch can run batch computing workloads of any scale. Batch
// automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes workload distribution
// based on the quantity and scale of your specific workloads. With Batch, there's
// no need to install or manage batch computing software. This means that you can
// focus your time and energy on analyzing results and solving your specific
// problems.
