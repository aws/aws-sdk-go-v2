//
// Welcome to the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller API Reference
// Guide for Recovery Control Data Plane . Recovery control in Route 53 Application
// Recovery Controller includes extremely reliable routing controls that enable you
// to recover applications by rerouting traffic, for example, across Availability
// Zones or AWS Regions. Routing controls are simple on/off switches hosted on a
// cluster. A cluster is a set of five redundant regional endpoints against which
// you can execute API calls to update or get the state of routing controls. You
// use routing controls to failover traffic to recover your application across
// Availability Zones or Regions. This API guide includes information about how to
// get and update routing control states in Route 53 Application Recovery
// Controller. For more information about Route 53 Application Recovery Controller,
// see the following:
//
// * You can create clusters, routing controls, and control
// panels by using the control plane API for Recovery Control. For more
// information, see Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Recovery
// Control API Reference
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/recovery-cluster/latest/api/).
//
// * Route 53
// Application Recovery Controller also provides continuous readiness checks to
// ensure that your applications are scaled to handle failover traffic. For more
// information about the related API actions, see Amazon Route 53 Application
// Recovery Controller Recovery Readiness API Reference
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/recovery-readiness/latest/api/).

// * For more
// information about creating resilient applications and preparing for recovery
// readiness with Route 53 Application Recovery Controller, see the Amazon Route 53
// Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.
