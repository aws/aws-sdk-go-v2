# v1.1.1 (2024-02-20)

* **Bug Fix**: When sourcing values for a service's `EndpointParameters`, the lack of a configured region (i.e. `options.Region == ""`) will now translate to a `nil` value for `EndpointParameters.Region` instead of a pointer to the empty string `""`. This will result in a much more explicit error when calling an operation instead of an obscure hostname lookup failure.
