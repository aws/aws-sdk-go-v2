// Package signer provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Signer.
//
// With code signing for IoT, you can sign code that you create for any IoT device
// that is supported by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Code signing is available
// through Amazon FreeRTOS (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/)
// and AWS IoT Device Management
// (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/), and integrated with AWS
// Certificate Manager (ACM) (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/). In
// order to sign code, you import a third-party code signing certificate with ACM
// that is used to sign updates in Amazon FreeRTOS and AWS IoT Device Management.
// For general information about using code signing, see the Code Signing for IoT
// Developer Guide
// (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html).
