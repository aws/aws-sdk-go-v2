// Package signer provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Signer.
//
// AWS Signer is a fully managed code-signing service to help you ensure the trust
// and integrity of your code. Signer supports the following applications: With
// code signing for AWS Lambda, you can sign AWS Lambda (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/)
// deployment packages. Integrated support is provided for Amazon S3 (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/)
// , Amazon CloudWatch (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/)
// , and AWS CloudTrail (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/)
// . In order to sign code, you create a signing profile and then use Signer to
// sign Lambda zip files in S3. With code signing for IoT, you can sign code for
// any IoT device that is supported by AWS. IoT code signing is available for
// Amazon FreeRTOS (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/) and AWS
// IoT Device Management (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/) ,
// and is integrated with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/)
// . In order to sign code, you import a third-party code-signing certificate using
// ACM, and use that to sign updates in Amazon FreeRTOS and AWS IoT Device
// Management. With Signer and the Notation CLI from the Notary  Project (https://notaryproject.dev/)
// , you can sign container images stored in a container registry such as Amazon
// Elastic Container Registry (ECR). The signatures are stored in the registry
// alongside the images, where they are available for verifying image authenticity
// and integrity. For more information about Signer, see the AWS Signer Developer
// Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html) .
