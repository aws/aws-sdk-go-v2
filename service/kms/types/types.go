	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-failed)
	// in AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. Valid values are:

	// *
	// CLUSTER_NOT_FOUND - AWS KMS cannot find the AWS CloudHSM cluster with the
	// specified cluster ID.
	//
	// * INSUFFICIENT_CLOUDHSM_HSMS - The associated AWS
	// CloudHSM cluster does not contain any active HSMs. To connect a custom key store
	// to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, the cluster must contain at least one active
	// HSM.
	//
	// * INTERNAL_ERROR - AWS KMS could not complete the request due to an
	// internal error. Retry the request. For ConnectCustomKeyStore requests,
	// disconnect the custom key store before trying to connect again.
	//
	// *
	// INVALID_CREDENTIALS - AWS KMS does not have the correct password for the kmsuser
	// crypto user in the AWS CloudHSM cluster. Before you can connect your custom key
	// store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, you must change the kmsuser account password
	// and update the key store password value for the custom key store.
	//
	// *
	// NETWORK_ERRORS - Network errors are preventing AWS KMS from connecting to the
	// custom key store.
	//
	// * SUBNET_NOT_FOUND - A subnet in the AWS CloudHSM cluster
	// configuration was deleted. If AWS KMS cannot find all of the subnets in the
	// cluster configuration, attempts to connect the custom key store to the AWS
	// CloudHSM cluster fail. To fix this error, create a cluster from a recent backup
	// and associate it with your custom key store. (This process creates a new cluster
	// configuration with a VPC and private subnets.) For details, see How to Fix a
	// Connection Failure
	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-failed)
	// in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
	//
	// * USER_LOCKED_OUT - The
	// kmsuser CU account is locked out of the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster due to
	// too many failed password attempts. Before you can connect your custom key store
	// to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, you must change the kmsuser account password and
	// update the key store password value for the custom key store.
	//
	// * USER_LOGGED_IN
	// - The kmsuser CU account is logged into the the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster.
	// This prevents AWS KMS from rotating the kmsuser account password and logging
	// into the cluster. Before you can connect your custom key store to its AWS
	// CloudHSM cluster, you must log the kmsuser CU out of the cluster. If you changed
	// the kmsuser password to log into the cluster, you must also and update the key
	// store password value for the custom key store. For help, see How to Log Out and
	// Reconnect
	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#login-kmsuser-2)
	// in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
	//
	// * USER_NOT_FOUND - AWS KMS
	// cannot find a kmsuser CU account in the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. Before
	// you can connect your custom key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, you must
	// create a kmsuser CU account in the cluster, and then update the key store
	// password value for the custom key store.
	ConnectionErrorCode ConnectionErrorCodeType

	// Indicates whether the custom key store is connected to its AWS CloudHSM cluster.
	// You can create and use CMKs in your custom key stores only when its connection
	// state is CONNECTED. The value is DISCONNECTED if the key store has never been
	// connected or you use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect it. If
	// the value is CONNECTED but you are having trouble using the custom key store,
	// make sure that its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster is active and contains at
	// least one active HSM. A value of FAILED indicates that an attempt to connect was
	// unsuccessful. The ConnectionErrorCode field in the response indicates the cause
	// of the failure. For help resolving a connection failure, see Troubleshooting a
	// Custom Key Store
	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html) in the

// case-sensitive match for the keys and values in the encryption context of the
// encryption operation. Only the order of the pairs can vary. However, in a grant
// constraint, the key in each key-value pair is not case sensitive, but the value
// is case sensitive. To avoid confusion, do not use multiple encryption context
// pairs that differ only by case. To require a fully case-sensitive encryption
// context, use the kms:EncryptionContext: and kms:EncryptionContextKeys conditions
// in an IAM or key policy. For details, see kms:EncryptionContext:
