// Information about the errors that are returned for each failed resource. This
// information can include InternalServiceException and InvalidParameterException
// errors. It can also include any valid error code returned by the AWS service
// that hosts the resource that the ARN key represents. The following are common
// error codes that you might receive from other AWS services:
//
// *
// InternalServiceException – This can mean that the Resource Groups Tagging API
// didn't receive a response from another AWS service. It can also mean the the
// resource type in the request is not supported by the Resource Groups Tagging
// API. In these cases, it's safe to retry the request and then call GetResources
// (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/API_GetResources.html)
// to verify the changes.
//
// * AccessDeniedException – This can mean that you need
// permission to calling tagging operations in the AWS service that contains the
// resource. For example, to use the Resource Groups Tagging API to tag a
// CloudWatch alarm resource, you need permission to call TagResources
// (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/API_TagResources.html)
// and TagResource
// (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html)
// in the CloudWatch API.
//
// For more information on errors that are generated from
// other AWS services, see the documentation for that service.
