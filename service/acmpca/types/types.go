// Validity specifies the period of time during which a certificate is valid.
// Validity can be expressed as an explicit date and time when the validity of a
// certificate starts or expires, or as a span of time after issuance, stated in
// days, months, or years. For more information, see Validity
// (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.5) in RFC 5280. ACM
// Private CA API consumes the Validity data type differently in two distinct
// parameters of the IssueCertificate action. The required parameter
// IssueCertificate:Validity specifies the end of a certificate's validity period.
// The optional parameter IssueCertificate:ValidityNotBefore specifies a customized
// starting time for the validity period.
type Validity struct {

	// Determines how ACM Private CA interprets the Value parameter, an integer.
	// Supported validity types include those listed below. Type definitions with
	// values include a sample input value and the resulting output. END_DATE: The
	// specific date and time when the certificate will expire, expressed using UTCTime
	// (YYMMDDHHMMSS) or GeneralizedTime (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) format. When UTCTime is used,
	// if the year field (YY) is greater than or equal to 50, the year is interpreted
	// as 19YY. If the year field is less than 50, the year is interpreted as 20YY.
	//
	// *
	// Sample input value: 491231235959 (UTCTime format)
	//
	// * Output expiration
	// date/time: 12/31/2049 23:59:59
	//
	// ABSOLUTE: The specific date and time when the
	// validity of a certificate will start or expire, expressed in seconds since the
	// Unix Epoch.
	//
	// * Sample input value: 2524608000
	//
	// * Output expiration date/time:
	// 01/01/2050 00:00:00
	//
	// DAYS, MONTHS, YEARS: The relative time from the moment of
	// issuance until the certificate will expire, expressed in days, months, or years.
	// Example if DAYS, issued on 10/12/2020 at 12:34:54 UTC:
	//
	// * Sample input value:
	// 90
	//
	// * Output expiration date: 01/10/2020 12:34:54 UTC
	//
	// The minimum validity
	// duration for a certificate using relative time (DAYS) is one day. The minimum
	// validity for a certificate using absolute time (ABSOLUTE or END_DATE) is one
	// second.
