// Package acmpca provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority.
//
// This is the ACM Private CA API Reference. It provides descriptions, syntax, and
// usage examples for each of the actions and data types involved in creating and
// managing private certificate authorities (CA) for your organization. The
// documentation for each action shows the Query API request parameters and the XML
// response. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's
// tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more
// information, see AWS SDKs (https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs). Each ACM Private
// CA API action has a quota that determines the number of times the action can be
// called per second. For more information, see API Rate Quotas in ACM Private CA
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/PcaLimits.html#PcaLimits-api)
// in the ACM Private CA user guide.
