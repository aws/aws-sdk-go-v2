// Package acmpca provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority.
//
// This is the Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority (PCA) API
// Reference. It provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the
// actions and data types involved in creating and managing a private certificate
// authority (CA) for your organization. The documentation for each action shows
// the API request parameters and the JSON response. Alternatively, you can use one
// of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the
// programming language or platform that you prefer. For more information, see
// Amazon Web Services SDKs (https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs). Each ACM Private
// CA API operation has a quota that determines the number of times the operation
// can be called per second. ACM Private CA throttles API requests at different
// rates depending on the operation. Throttling means that ACM Private CA rejects
// an otherwise valid request because the request exceeds the operation's quota for
// the number of requests per second. When a request is throttled, ACM Private CA
// returns a ThrottlingException
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html)
// error. ACM Private CA does not guarantee a minimum request rate for APIs. To see
// an up-to-date list of your ACM Private CA quotas, or to request a quota
// increase, log into your Amazon Web Services account and visit the Service Quotas
// (https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/) console.
