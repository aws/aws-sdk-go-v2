// Package applicationdiscoveryservice provides the API client, operations, and
// parameter types for AWS Application Discovery Service.
//
// Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service Amazon Web Services
// Application Discovery Service helps you plan application migration projects. It
// automatically identifies servers, virtual machines (VMs), and network
// dependencies in your on-premises data centers. For more information, see the
// Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service FAQ (http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/)
// . Application Discovery Service offers three ways of performing discovery and
// collecting data about your on-premises servers:
//
//   - Agentless discovery is recommended for environments that use VMware vCenter
//     Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on each host. It does
//     not work in non-VMware environments.
//
//   - Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the operating
//     systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises
//     infrastructure assessment.
//
//   - Agentless discovery doesn't collect information about network dependencies,
//     only agent-based discovery collects that information.
//
//   - Agent-based discovery collects a richer set of data than agentless
//     discovery by using the Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Agent, which
//     you install on one or more hosts in your data center.
//
//   - The agent captures infrastructure and application information, including an
//     inventory of running processes, system performance information, resource
//     utilization, and network dependencies.
//
//   - The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to
//     the Application Discovery Service database in the cloud.
//
//   - Amazon Web Services Partner Network (APN) solutions integrate with
//     Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import details of your
//     on-premises environment directly into Migration Hub without using the discovery
//     connector or discovery agent.
//
//   - Third-party application discovery tools can query Amazon Web Services
//     Application Discovery Service, and they can write to the Application Discovery
//     Service database using the public API.
//
//   - In this way, you can import data into Migration Hub and view it, so that
//     you can associate applications with servers and track migrations.
//
// Recommendations We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware
// environments, and whenever you want to collect information about network
// dependencies. You can run agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously.
// Use agentless discovery to complete the initial infrastructure assessment
// quickly, and then install agents on select hosts to collect additional
// information. Working With This Guide This API reference provides descriptions,
// syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for
// Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows the API request
// parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web
// Services SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming language or
// platform that you're using. For more information, see Amazon Web Services SDKs (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs)
// .
//   - Remember that you must set your Migration Hub home region before you call
//     any of these APIs.
//   - You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify, associate,
//     disassociate, import, or put) while in your home region, or a
//     HomeRegionNotSetException error is returned.
//   - API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are permitted
//     outside of your home region.
//   - Although it is unlikely, the Migration Hub home region could change. If you
//     call APIs outside the home region, an InvalidInputException is returned.
//   - You must call GetHomeRegion to obtain the latest Migration Hub home region.
//
// This guide is intended for use with the Amazon Web Services Application
// Discovery Service User Guide (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/)
// . All data is handled according to the Amazon Web Services Privacy Policy (http://aws.amazon.com/privacy/)
// . You can operate Application Discovery Service offline to inspect collected
// data before it is shared with the service.
