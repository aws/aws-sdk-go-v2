type AdvancedFieldSelector struct {

	// A field in an event record on which to filter events to be logged. Supported

	// eventName, resources.type, and resources.ARN.
	//
	// * readOnly - Optional. Can be set
	// to Equals a value of true or false. A value of false logs both read and write
	// events.
	//
	// * eventSource - For filtering management events only. This can be set
	// only to NotEqualskms.amazonaws.com.
	//
	// * eventName - Can use any operator. You can
	// use it to ﬁlter in or ﬁlter out any data event logged to CloudTrail, such as
	// PutBucket. You can have multiple values for this ﬁeld, separated by commas.
	//
	// *
	// eventCategory - This is required. It must be set to Equals, and the value must
	// be Management or Data.
	//
	// * resources.type - This ﬁeld is required. resources.type
	// can only use the Equals operator, and the value can be one of the following:
	// AWS::S3::Object, AWS::Lambda::Function, or AWS::S3Outposts::Object. You can have
	// only one resources.type ﬁeld per selector. To log data events on more than one
	// resource type, add another selector.
	//
	// * resources.ARN - You can use any operator
	// with resources.ARN, but if you use Equals or NotEquals, the value must exactly
	// match the ARN of a valid resource of the type you've speciﬁed in the template as
	// the value of resources.type. For example, if resources.type equals
	// AWS::S3::Object, the ARN must be in one of the following formats. The trailing
	// slash is intentional; do not exclude it.
	//
	// * arn:partition:s3:::bucket_name/
	//
	// *
	// arn:partition:s3:::bucket_name/object_or_file_name/
	//
	// When resources.type equals
	// AWS::Lambda::Function, and the operator is set to Equals or NotEquals, the ARN
	// must be in the following format:
	//
	// *
	// arn:partition:lambda:region:account_ID:function:function_name
	//
	// When
	// resources.type equals AWS::S3Outposts::Object, and the operator is set to Equals
	// or NotEquals, the ARN must be in the following format:

	// *
	// arn:partition:s3-outposts:region:>account_ID:object_path

}

// The Amazon S3 buckets or AWS Lambda functions that you specify in your event
// selectors for your trail to log data events. Data events provide information
// about the resource operations performed on or within a resource itself. These
// are also known as data plane operations. You can specify up to 250 data
// resources for a trail. The total number of allowed data resources is 250. This
// number can be distributed between 1 and 5 event selectors, but the total cannot
// exceed 250 across all selectors. If you are using advanced event selectors, the
// maximum total number of values for all conditions, across all advanced event
// selectors for the trail, is 500. The following example demonstrates how logging
// works when you configure logging of all data events for an S3 bucket named
// bucket-1. In this example, the CloudTrail user specified an empty prefix, and
// the option to log both Read and Write data events.
//
// * A user uploads an image
// file to bucket-1.
//
// * The PutObject API operation is an Amazon S3 object-level
// API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user
// specified an S3 bucket with an empty prefix, events that occur on any object in
// that bucket are logged. The trail processes and logs the event.
//
// * A user
// uploads an object to an Amazon S3 bucket named arn:aws:s3:::bucket-2.
//
// * The
// PutObject API operation occurred for an object in an S3 bucket that the
// CloudTrail user didn't specify for the trail. The trail doesn’t log the
// event.
//
// The following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure
// logging of AWS Lambda data events for a Lambda function named MyLambdaFunction,
// but not for all AWS Lambda functions.
//
// * A user runs a script that includes a
// call to the MyLambdaFunction function and the MyOtherLambdaFunction function.
//
// *
// The Invoke API operation on MyLambdaFunction is an AWS Lambda API. It is
// recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified
// logging data events for MyLambdaFunction, any invocations of that function are
// logged. The trail processes and logs the event.
//
// * The Invoke API operation on
// MyOtherLambdaFunction is an AWS Lambda API. Because the CloudTrail user did not
// specify logging data events for all Lambda functions, the Invoke operation for
// MyOtherLambdaFunction does not match the function specified for the trail. The
// trail doesn’t log the event.
type DataResource struct {

	// The resource type in which you want to log data events. You can specify
	// AWS::S3::Object or AWS::Lambda::Function resources. The AWS::S3Outposts::Object
	// resource type is not valid in basic event selectors. To log data events on this
	// resource type, use advanced event selectors.
	Type *string

	// An array of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) strings or partial ARN strings for the
	// specified objects.
	//
	// * To log data events for all objects in all S3 buckets in
	// your AWS account, specify the prefix as arn:aws:s3:::. This will also enable
	// logging of data event activity performed by any user or role in your AWS
	// account, even if that activity is performed on a bucket that belongs to another
	// AWS account.
	//
	// * To log data events for all objects in an S3 bucket, specify the
	// bucket and an empty object prefix such as arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/. The trail logs
	// data events for all objects in this S3 bucket.
	//
	// * To log data events for
	// specific objects, specify the S3 bucket and object prefix such as
	// arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/example-images. The trail logs data events for objects in
	// this S3 bucket that match the prefix.
	//
	// * To log data events for all functions in
	// your AWS account, specify the prefix as arn:aws:lambda. This will also enable
	// logging of Invoke activity performed by any user or role in your AWS account,
	// even if that activity is performed on a function that belongs to another AWS
	// account.
	//
	// * To log data events for a specific Lambda function, specify the
	// function ARN. Lambda function ARNs are exact. For example, if you specify a
	// function ARN arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld, data
	// events will only be logged for
	// arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld. They will not be
	// logged for arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld2.
