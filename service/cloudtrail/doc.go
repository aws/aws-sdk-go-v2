// Package cloudtrail provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// AWS CloudTrail.
//
// AWS CloudTrail This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of
// actions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail.
// CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and
// delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information includes the
// identity of the user, the start time of the AWS API call, the source IP address,
// the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the service. As an
// alternative to the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of
// libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java,
// Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create
// programmatic access to AWSCloudTrail. For example, the SDKs take care of
// cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests
// automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and
// install them, see the Tools for Amazon Web Services page
// (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/). See the AWS CloudTrail User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html)
// for information about the data that is included with each AWS API call listed in
// the log files.
