// Retrieves a service last accessed report that was created using the
// GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails operation. You can use the JobId parameter in
// GetServiceLastAccessedDetails to retrieve the status of your report job. When
// the report is complete, you can retrieve the generated report. The report
// includes a list of AWS services that the resource (user, group, role, or managed
// policy) can access. Service last accessed data does not use other policy types
// when determining whether a resource could access a service. These other policy
// types include resource-based policies, access control lists, AWS Organizations
// policies, IAM permissions boundaries, and AWS STS assume role policies. It only
// applies permissions policy logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types,
// see Evaluating Policies
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics)
// in the IAM User Guide. For each service that the resource could access using
// permissions policies, the operation returns details about the most recent access
// attempt. If there was no attempt, the service is listed without details about
// the most recent attempt to access the service. If the operation fails, the
// GetServiceLastAccessedDetails operation returns the reason that it failed. The
// GetServiceLastAccessedDetails operation returns a list of services. This list
// includes the number of entities that have attempted to access the service and
// the date and time of the last attempt. It also returns the ARN of the following
// entity, depending on the resource ARN that you used to generate the report:
//
//
// * User – Returns the user ARN that you used to generate the report
//
//     * Group
// – Returns the ARN of the group member (user) that last attempted to access the
// service
//
//     * Role – Returns the role ARN that you used to generate the
// report
//
//     * Policy – Returns the ARN of the user or role that last used the
// policy to attempt to access the service
//
// By default, the list is sorted by
// service namespace. If you specified ACTION_LEVEL granularity when you generated
// the report, this operation returns service and action last accessed data. This
// includes the most recent access attempt for each tracked action within a
// service. Otherwise, this operation returns only service data. For more
// information about service and action last accessed data, see Reducing
// Permissions Using Service Last Accessed Data
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html)
// in the IAM User Guide.
