// Simulate how a set of IAM policies attached to an IAM entity works with a list
// of API operations and AWS resources to determine the policies' effective
// permissions. The entity can be an IAM user, group, or role. If you specify a
// user, then the simulation also includes all of the policies that are attached to
// groups that the user belongs to. You can optionally include a list of one or
// more additional policies specified as strings to include in the simulation. If
// you want to simulate only policies specified as strings, use
// SimulateCustomPolicy () instead. You can also optionally include one
// resource-based policy to be evaluated with each of the resources included in the
// simulation. The simulation does not perform the API operations; it only checks
// the authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the
// operations. Note: This API discloses information about the permissions granted
// to other users. If you do not want users to see other user's permissions, then
// consider allowing them to use SimulateCustomPolicy () instead. Context keys are
// variables maintained by AWS and its services that provide details about the
// context of an API query request. You can use the Condition element of an IAM
// policy to evaluate context keys. To get the list of context keys that the
// policies require for correct simulation, use GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy
// (). If the output is long, you can use the MaxItems and Marker parameters to
// paginate the results.

	// and reports it in the response. The simulation does not automatically retrieve
	// policies for the specified resources. If you want to include a resource policy

	// include both a PolicySourceArn (for example,
	// arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/David) and a CallerArn (for example,
	// arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Bob), the result is that you simulate calling the
	// API operations as Bob, as if Bob had David's policies. You can specify only the
	// ARN of an IAM user. You cannot specify the ARN of an assumed role, federated
	// user, or a service principal. CallerArn is required if you include a
	// ResourcePolicy and the PolicySourceArn is not the ARN for an IAM user. This is
	// required so that the resource-based policy's Principal element has a value to
	// use in evaluating the policy. For more information about ARNs, see Amazon

	MaxItems *int32
	// Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a
	// response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the
	// Marker element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call
	// should start.
	Marker *string
	// Specifies the type of simulation to run. Different API operations that support
	// resource-based policies require different combinations of resources. By
	// specifying the type of simulation to run, you enable the policy simulator to
	// enforce the presence of the required resources to ensure reliable simulation
	// results. If your simulation does not match one of the following scenarios, then
	// you can omit this parameter. The following list shows each of the supported
	// scenario values and the resources that you must define to run the simulation.
	// Each of the EC2 scenarios requires that you specify instance, image, and
	// security group resources. If your scenario includes an EBS volume, then you must
	// specify that volume as a resource. If the EC2 scenario includes VPC, then you
	// must supply the network interface resource. If it includes an IP subnet, then
	// you must specify the subnet resource. For more information on the EC2 scenario
	// options, see Supported Platforms
