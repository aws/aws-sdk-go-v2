//
// AWS IoT Core Device Advisor is a cloud-based, fully managed test capability for

// provides pre-built tests that you can use to validate IoT devices for reliable
// and secure connectivity with AWS IoT Core before deploying devices to
// production. By using Device Advisor, you can confirm that your devices can
// connect to AWS IoT Core, follow security best practices and, if applicable,
// receive software updates from IoT Device Management. You can also download
// signed qualification reports to submit to the AWS Partner Network to get your
// device qualified for the AWS Partner Device Catalog without the need to send
// your device in and wait for it to be tested.
