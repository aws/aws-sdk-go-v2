// Package paymentcryptography provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for Payment Cryptography Control Plane.
//
// You use the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Control Plane to manage
// the encryption keys you use for payment-related cryptographic operations. You
// can create, import, export, share, manage, and delete keys. You can also manage
// Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for keys. For more information,
// see Identity and access management (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/security-iam.html)
// in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. To use encryption
// keys for payment-related transaction processing and associated cryptographic
// operations, you use the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Data Plane (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/DataAPIReference/Welcome.html)
// . You can encrypt, decrypt, generate, verify, and translate payment-related
// cryptographic operations. All Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography API calls
// must be signed and transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). We
// recommend you always use the latest supported TLS version for logging API
// requests. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports CloudTrail, a
// service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related events for your
// Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you
// specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine
// what requests were made to Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, who made
// the request, when it was made, and so on. If you don't conÔ¨Ågure a trail, you can
// still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console. For more
// information, see the CloudTrail User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/)
