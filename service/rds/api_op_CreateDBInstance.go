	PromotionTier *int32

	// Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible. When the DB instance
	// is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the
	// private IP address from within the DB instance's virtual private cloud (VPC). It
	// resolves to the public IP address from outside of the DB instance's VPC. Access
	// to the DB instance is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That

	// specified, the following applies:

	//   attached to it, the DB instance is private.
	//   - If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway attached to
	//   it, the DB instance is public.
	// If DBSubnetGroupName is specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't specified, the
	// following applies:
	//   - If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn’t have an internet gateway
	//   attached to it, the DB instance is private.
	//   - If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway attached to
