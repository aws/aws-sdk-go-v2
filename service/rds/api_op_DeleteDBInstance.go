// DeleteDBInstanceRequest returns a request value for making API operation for
// Amazon Relational Database Service.
//
// The DeleteDBInstance action deletes a previously provisioned DB instance.
// When you delete a DB instance, all automated backups for that instance are
// deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB snapshots of the DB instance to
// be deleted by DeleteDBInstance are not deleted.
//
// If you request a final DB snapshot the status of the Amazon RDS DB instance
// is deleting until the DB snapshot is created. The API action DescribeDBInstance
// is used to monitor the status of this operation. The action can't be canceled
// or reverted once submitted.
//
// Note that when a DB instance is in a failure state and has a status of failed,
// incompatible-restore, or incompatible-network, you can only delete it when
// you skip creation of the final snapshot with the SkipFinalSnapshot parameter.
//
// If the specified DB instance is part of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, you
// can't delete the DB instance if both of the following conditions are true:
//
//    * The DB cluster is a Read Replica of another Amazon Aurora DB cluster.
//
//    * The DB instance is the only instance in the DB cluster.
//
// To delete a DB instance in this case, first call the PromoteReadReplicaDBCluster
// API action to promote the DB cluster so it's no longer a Read Replica. After
// the promotion completes, then call the DeleteDBInstance API action to delete
// the final instance in the DB cluster.
//
//    // Example sending a request using DeleteDBInstanceRequest.
//    req := client.DeleteDBInstanceRequest(params)
//    resp, err := req.Send(context.TODO())
//    if err == nil {
//        fmt.Println(resp)
//    }
