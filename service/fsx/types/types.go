	// STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION - Once the FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE task to increase a file
	// system's storage capacity completes successfully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task

	//
	// * For Windows, storage optimization is the process of migrating the
	// file system data to the new, larger disks.

	// * For Lustre, storage optimization
	// consists of rebalancing the data across the existing and newly added file
	// servers.
	//
	// You can track the storage optimization progress using the
