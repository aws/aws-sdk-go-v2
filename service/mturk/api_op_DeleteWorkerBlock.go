// DeleteWorkerBlockRequest returns a request value for making API operation for
// Amazon Mechanical Turk.
//
// The DeleteWorkerBlock operation allows you to reinstate a blocked Worker
// to work on your HITs. This operation reverses the effects of the CreateWorkerBlock
// operation. You need the Worker ID to use this operation. If the Worker ID
// is missing or invalid, this operation fails and returns the message “WorkerId
// is invalid.” If the specified Worker is not blocked, this operation returns
// successfully.
//
//    // Example sending a request using DeleteWorkerBlockRequest.

//    resp, err := req.Send(context.TODO())
//    if err == nil {
//        fmt.Println(resp)
