// The CreateHIT operation creates a new Human Intelligence Task (HIT). The new HIT
// is made available for Workers to find and accept on the Amazon Mechanical Turk
// website. This operation allows you to specify a new HIT by passing in values for
// the properties of the HIT, such as its title, reward amount and number of
// assignments. When you pass these values to CreateHIT, a new HIT is created for
// you, with a new HITTypeID. The HITTypeID can be used to create additional HITs
// in the future without needing to specify common parameters such as the title,
// description and reward amount each time. An alternative way to create HITs is to
// first generate a HITTypeID using the CreateHITType operation and then call the
// CreateHITWithHITType operation. This is the recommended best practice for
// Requesters who are creating large numbers of HITs.  <p>CreateHIT also supports
// several ways to provide question data: by providing a value for the
// <code>Question</code> parameter that fully specifies the contents of the HIT, or
// by providing a <code>HitLayoutId</code> and associated
// <code>HitLayoutParameters</code>. </p> <note> <p> If a HIT is created with 10 or
// more maximum assignments, there is an additional fee. For more information, see
// <a href="https://requester.mturk.com/pricing">Amazon Mechanical Turk
// Pricing</a>.</p> </note>

	// values and create an additional HIT by providing those values as
	// HITLayoutParameters. Constraints: Either a Question parameter or a HITLayoutId
	// parameter must be provided.
	HITLayoutId *string
	// A general description of the HIT. A description includes detailed information
	// about the kind of task the HIT contains. On the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site,
	// the HIT description appears in the expanded view of search results, and in the
	// HIT and assignment screens. A good description gives the user enough information
	// to evaluate the HIT before accepting it.
	Description *string
	// The amount of money the Requester will pay a Worker for successfully completing
	// the HIT.
	Reward *string
	// Conditions that a Worker's Qualifications must meet in order to accept the HIT.
	// A HIT can have between zero and ten Qualification requirements. All requirements
	// must be met in order for a Worker to accept the HIT. Additionally, other actions
	// can be restricted using the ActionsGuarded field on each
	// QualificationRequirement structure.
	QualificationRequirements []*types.QualificationRequirement
	// An amount of time, in seconds, after which the HIT is no longer available for
	// users to accept. After the lifetime of the HIT elapses, the HIT no longer
	// appears in HIT searches, even if not all of the assignments for the HIT have
	// been accepted.
	LifetimeInSeconds *int64
	// The amount of time, in seconds, that a Worker has to complete the HIT after
	// accepting it. If a Worker does not complete the assignment within the specified
	// duration, the assignment is considered abandoned. If the HIT is still active
	// (that is, its lifetime has not elapsed), the assignment becomes available for
	// other users to find and accept.
	AssignmentDurationInSeconds *int64
	// The title of the HIT. A title should be short and descriptive about the kind of
	// task the HIT contains. On the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, the HIT title
	// appears in search results, and everywhere the HIT is mentioned.
	Title *string
	// A unique identifier for this request which allows you to retry the call on error
	// without creating duplicate HITs. This is useful in cases such as network
	// timeouts where it is unclear whether or not the call succeeded on the server. If
	// the HIT already exists in the system from a previous call using the same
	// UniqueRequestToken, subsequent calls will return a
	// AWS.MechanicalTurk.HitAlreadyExists error with a message containing the HITId.
	// Note: It is your responsibility to ensure uniqueness of the token. The unique
	// token expires after 24 hours. Subsequent calls using the same UniqueRequestToken
	// made after the 24 hour limit could create duplicate HITs.
	UniqueRequestToken *string
	// The number of seconds after an assignment for the HIT has been submitted, after
	// which the assignment is considered Approved automatically unless the Requester
	// explicitly rejects it.
	AutoApprovalDelayInSeconds *int64
	// The data the person completing the HIT uses to produce the results. Constraints:
	// Must be a QuestionForm data structure, an ExternalQuestion data structure, or an
	// HTMLQuestion data structure. The XML question data must not be larger than 64
	// kilobytes (65,535 bytes) in size, including whitespace. Either a Question
	// parameter or a HITLayoutId parameter must be provided.

	// The HIT-level Review Policy applies to the HIT. You can specify for Mechanical
	// Turk to take various actions based on the policy.
	HITReviewPolicy *types.ReviewPolicy
	// The Assignment-level Review Policy applies to the assignments under the HIT. You
	// can specify for Mechanical Turk to take various actions based on the policy.
	AssignmentReviewPolicy *types.ReviewPolicy
	// An arbitrary data field. The RequesterAnnotation parameter lets your application
	// attach arbitrary data to the HIT for tracking purposes. For example, this
	// parameter could be an identifier internal to the Requester's application that
	// corresponds with the HIT. The RequesterAnnotation parameter for a HIT is only
	// visible to the Requester who created the HIT. It is not shown to the Worker, or
	// any other Requester. The RequesterAnnotation parameter may be different for each
	// HIT you submit. It does not affect how your HITs are grouped.
	RequesterAnnotation *string
	// If the HITLayoutId is provided, any placeholder values must be filled in with
	// values using the HITLayoutParameter structure. For more information, see
	// HITLayout.
