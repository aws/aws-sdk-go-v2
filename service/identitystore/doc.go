// Package identitystore provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS SSO Identity Store.
//
// The Identity Store service used by AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS
// Single Sign-On) provides a single place to retrieve all of your identities
// (users and groups). For more information, see the IAM Identity Center User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html).
// Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the sso and identitystore API
// namespaces will continue to retain their original name for backward
// compatibility purposes. For more information, see IAM Identity Center rename
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed).
// This reference guide describes the identity store operations that you can call
// programatically and includes detailed information on data types and errors.
