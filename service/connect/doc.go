// Amazon Connect Service.
//
// Amazon Connect is a cloud-based contact center solution that makes it easy to
// set up and manage a customer contact center and provide reliable customer
// engagement at any scale. Amazon Connect provides rich metrics and real-time
// reporting that allow you to optimize contact routing. You can also resolve
// customer issues more efficiently by putting customers in touch with the right
// agents. There are limits to the number of Amazon Connect resources that you can
// create and limits to the number of requests that you can make per second. For
// more information, see Amazon Connect Service Quotas
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html)
// in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide. To connect programmatically to an AWS
// service, you use an endpoint. For a list of Amazon Connect endpoints, see Amazon
// Connect Endpoints
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/connect_region.html). Working
// with contact flows? Check out the Amazon Connect Flow language
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/flow-language.html).
