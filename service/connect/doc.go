// Amazon Connect is a cloud-based contact center solution that you use to set up
// and manage a customer contact center and provide reliable customer engagement at
// any scale. Amazon Connect provides metrics and real-time reporting that enable
// you to optimize contact routing. You can also resolve customer issues more
// efficiently by getting customers in touch with the appropriate agents. There are
// limits to the number of Amazon Connect resources that you can create. There are
// also limits to the number of requests that you can make per second. For more
// information, see Amazon Connect Service Quotas (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html)
// in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide. You can connect programmatically to
// an Amazon Web Services service by using an endpoint. For a list of Amazon
// Connect endpoints, see Amazon Connect Endpoints (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/connect_region.html)
