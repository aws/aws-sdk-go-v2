// Represents user interaction event information sent using the PutEvents API.
type Event struct {

	// The type of event. This property corresponds to the EVENT_TYPE field of the
	// Interactions schema.
	//
	// This member is required.
	EventType *string

	// A string map of event-specific data that you might choose to record. For
	// example, if a user rates a movie on your site, you might send the movie ID and
	// rating, and the number of movie ratings made by the user. Each item in the map
	// consists of a key-value pair. For example, {"itemId": "movie1"}
	//     {"itemId":
	// "movie2", "eventValue": "4.5"}
	//
	// {"itemId": "movie3", "eventValue": "3",
	// "numberOfRatings": "12"} The keys use camel case names that match the fields in
	// the Interactions schema. The itemId and eventValue keys correspond to the
	// ITEM_ID and EVENT_VALUE fields. In the above example, the eventType might be
	// 'MovieRating' with eventValue being the rating. The numberOfRatings would match
	// the 'NUMBER_OF_RATINGS' field defined in the Interactions schema.
	// This value conforms to the media type: application/json
	//
	// This member is required.
	Properties *string

	// The timestamp on the client side when the event occurred.
	//
	// This member is required.
	SentAt *time.Time

	// An ID associated with the event. If an event ID is not provided, Amazon
	// Personalize generates a unique ID for the event. An event ID is not used as an
	// input to the model. Amazon Personalize uses the event ID to distinquish unique
	// events. Any subsequent events after the first with the same event ID are not
	// used in model training.
	EventId *string
}
