// Package snowball provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon Import/Export Snowball.
//
// AWS Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure
// devices to transfer large amounts of data between your on-premises data centers
// and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Snowball commands described
// here provide access to the same functionality that is available in the AWS
// Snowball Management Console, which enables you to create and manage jobs for
// Snowball. To transfer data locally with a Snowball device, you'll need to use
// the Snowball client or the Amazon S3 API adapter for Snowball. For more
// information, see the User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html).
