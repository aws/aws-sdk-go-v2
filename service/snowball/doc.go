// Amazon Import/Export Snowball.
//
// AWS Snow Family is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure
// devices to transfer large amounts of data between your on-premises data centers
// and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Snow commands described here
// provide access to the same functionality that is available in the AWS Snow
// Family Management Console, which enables you to create and manage jobs for a
// Snow device. To transfer data locally with a Snow device, you'll need to use the
// Snowball Edge client or the Amazon S3 API Interface for Snowball or AWS OpsHub
// for Snow Family. For more information, see the User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html).
