// Package chime provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon Chime.
//
// The Amazon Chime API (application programming interface) is designed for
// developers to perform key tasks, such as creating and managing Amazon Chime
// accounts, users, and Voice Connectors. This guide provides detailed information
// about the Amazon Chime API, including operations, types, inputs and outputs, and
// error codes. It also includes API actions for use with the Amazon Chime SDK,
// which developers use to build their own communication applications. For more
// information about the Amazon Chime SDK, see  Using the Amazon Chime SDK
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/dg/meetings-sdk.html) in the Amazon
// Chime Developer Guide. You can use an AWS SDK, the AWS Command Line Interface
// (AWS CLI), or the REST API to make API calls. We recommend using an AWS SDK or
// the AWS CLI. Each API operation includes links to information about using it
// with a language-specific AWS SDK or the AWS CLI. Using an AWS SDK You don't need
// to write code to calculate a signature for request authentication. The SDK
// clients authenticate your requests by using access keys that you provide. For
// more information about AWS SDKs, see the AWS Developer Center
// (http://aws.amazon.com/developer/). Using the AWS CLI Use your access keys with
// the AWS CLI to make API calls. For information about setting up the AWS CLI, see
// Installing the AWS Command Line Interface
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) in the AWS
// Command Line Interface User Guide. For a list of available Amazon Chime
// commands, see the Amazon Chime commands
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/chime/index.html) in the AWS
// CLI Command Reference. Using REST APIs If you use REST to make API calls, you
// must authenticate your request by providing a signature. Amazon Chime supports
// signature version 4. For more information, see Signature Version 4 Signing
// Process (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html)
// in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. When making REST API calls, use
// the service name chime and REST endpoint https://service.chime.aws.amazon.com.
// Administrative permissions are controlled using AWS Identity and Access
// Management (IAM). For more information, see Identity and Access Management for
// Amazon Chime (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ag/security-iam.html) in
// the Amazon Chime Administration Guide.
