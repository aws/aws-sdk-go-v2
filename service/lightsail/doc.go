// Package lightsail provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon Lightsail.
//
// Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web Services
// (AWS) for developers who need to build websites or web applications. It includes
// everything you need to launch your project quickly - instances (virtual private
// servers), container services, storage buckets, managed databases, SSD-based
// block storage, static IP addresses, load balancers, content delivery network
// (CDN) distributions, DNS management of registered domains, and resource
// snapshots (backups) - for a low, predictable monthly price. You can manage your
// Lightsail resources using the Lightsail console, Lightsail API, AWS Command Line
// Interface (AWS CLI), or SDKs. For more information about Lightsail concepts and
// tasks, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide
// (https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli).
// This API Reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types,
// parameters, and errors of the Lightsail service. For more information about the
// supported AWS Regions, endpoints, and service quotas of the Lightsail service,
// see Amazon Lightsail Endpoints and Quotas
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lightsail.html) in the AWS
// General Reference.
