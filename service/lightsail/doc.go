// Package lightsail provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon Lightsail.
//
// Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web Services
// (AWS) for developers who need to build websites or web applications. It includes
// everything you need to launch your project quickly - instances (virtual private
// servers), container services, managed databases, SSD-based block storage, static
// IP addresses, load balancers, content delivery network (CDN) distributions, DNS
// management of registered domains, and resource snapshots (backups) - for a low,
// predictable monthly price. You can manage your Lightsail resources using the
// Lightsail console, Lightsail API, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or SDKs.
// For more information about Lightsail concepts and tasks, see the Lightsail Dev
// Guide
// (http://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/how-to/article/lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli).
// This API Reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types,
// parameters, and errors of the Lightsail service. For more information about the
// supported AWS Regions, endpoints, and service quotas of the Lightsail service,
// see Amazon Lightsail Endpoints and Quotas
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lightsail.html) in the AWS
// General Reference.
