	// values.
	Measurement *Measurement

	// Specifies an asset metric property. A metric contains a mathematical expression
	// that uses aggregate functions to process all input data points over a time
	// interval and output a single data point, such as to calculate the average hourly
	// temperature.
	Metric *Metric

	// expression that maps a property's data points from one form to another, such as
	// a unit conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

// Contains an asset transform property. A transform is a one-to-one mapping of a
// property's data points from one form to another. For example, you can use a
// transform to convert a Celsius data stream to Fahrenheit by applying the
// transformation expression to each data point of the Celsius stream. A transform
// can only have a data type of DOUBLE and consume properties with data types of
// INTEGER or DOUBLE. For more information, see Transforms
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/asset-properties.html#transforms)
// in the AWS IoT SiteWise User Guide.
type Transform struct {

	// The mathematical expression that defines the transformation function. You can

}

// Contains a tumbling window, which is a repeating fixed-sized, non-overlapping,
// and contiguous time interval. This window is used in metric and aggregation
// computations.
type TumblingWindow struct {

	// The time interval for the tumbling window. Note that w represents weeks, d
	// represents days, h represents hours, and m represents minutes. AWS IoT SiteWise
	// computes the 1w interval the end of Sunday at midnight each week (UTC), the 1d
	// interval at the end of each day at midnight (UTC), the 1h interval at the end of
	// each hour, and so on. When AWS IoT SiteWise aggregates data points for metric
	// computations, the start of each interval is exclusive and the end of each
	// interval is inclusive. AWS IoT SiteWise places the computed data point at the
	// end of the interval.

type VariableValue struct {

	// The ID of the property to use as the variable. You can use the property name if

	// This member is required.
	PropertyId *string

	// The ID of the hierarchy to query for the property ID. You can use the
	// hierarchy's name instead of the hierarchy's ID. You use a hierarchy ID instead
	// of a model ID because you can have several hierarchies using the same model and
	// therefore the same propertyId. For example, you might have separately grouped
	// assets that come from the same asset model. For more information, see Asset
