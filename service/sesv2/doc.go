// Package sesv2 provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon Simple Email Service.
//
// Amazon SES API v2 Welcome to the Amazon SES API v2 Reference. This guide
// provides information about the Amazon SES API v2, including supported
// operations, data types, parameters, and schemas. Amazon SES
// (https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint) is an AWS service that you can use to send
// email messages to your customers. If you're new to Amazon SES API v2, you might
// find it helpful to also review the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/). The Amazon SES
// Developer Guide provides information and code samples that demonstrate how to
// use Amazon SES API v2 features programmatically. The Amazon SES API v2 is
// available in several AWS Regions and it provides an endpoint for each of these
// Regions. For a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently
// available, see AWS Service Endpoints
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ses_region) in the
// Amazon Web Services General Reference. To learn more about AWS Regions, see
// Managing AWS Regions
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html) in the Amazon
// Web Services General Reference. In each Region, AWS maintains multiple
// Availability Zones. These Availability Zones are physically isolated from each
// other, but are united by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly
// redundant network connections. These Availability Zones enable us to provide
// very high levels of availability and redundancy, while also minimizing latency.
// To learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are available in each
// Region, see AWS Global Infrastructure
// (http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/).
