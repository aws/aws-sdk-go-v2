// Package apprunner provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// AWS App Runner.
//
// AWS App Runner AWS App Runner is an application service that provides a fast,
// simple, and cost-effective way to go directly from an existing container image
// or source code to a running service in the AWS cloud in seconds. You don't need
// to learn new technologies, decide which compute service to use, or understand
// how to provision and configure AWS resources. App Runner connects directly to
// your container registry or source code repository. It provides an automatic
// delivery pipeline with fully managed operations, high performance, scalability,
// and security. For more information about App Runner, see the AWS App Runner
// Developer Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/). For release
// information, see the AWS App Runner Release Notes
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/relnotes/). To install the
// Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
// Toolkits, and command line tools that you can use to access the API, see Tools
// for Amazon Web Services (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/). Endpoints For a list of
// Region-specific endpoints that App Runner supports, see AWS App Runner endpoints
// and quotas (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/apprunner.html) in the
// AWS General Reference.
