// AAWS Sever Migration Service This is the AWS Sever Migration Service API
// Reference. It provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the
// actions and data types for the AWS Sever Migration Service (AWS SMS). The topic
// for each action shows the Query API request parameters and the XML response. You
// can also view the XML request elements in the WSDL. Alternatively, you can use

// or platform that you're using. For more information, see AWS SDKs
