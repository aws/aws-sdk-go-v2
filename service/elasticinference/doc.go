// Elastic Inference public APIs. February 15, 2023: Starting April 15, 2023, AWS
// will not onboard new customers to Amazon Elastic Inference (EI), and will help
// current customers migrate their workloads to options that offer better price and
// performance. After April 15, 2023, new customers will not be able to launch
// instances with Amazon EI accelerators in Amazon SageMaker, Amazon ECS, or Amazon
// EC2. However, customers who have used Amazon EI at least once during the past
// 30-day period are considered current customers and will be able to continue
// using the service.
