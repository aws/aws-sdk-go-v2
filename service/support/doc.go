// Package support provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Support.
//
// AWS Support The AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers who need
// detailed information about the AWS Support operations and data types. This
// service enables you to manage your AWS Support cases programmatically. It uses
// HTTP methods that return results in JSON format.
//
// * You must have a Business or
// Enterprise support plan to use the AWS Support API.
//
// * If you call the AWS
// Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise support
// plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message appears. For information
// about changing your support plan, see AWS Support
// (http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/).
//
// The AWS Support service also exposes a
// set of AWS Trusted Advisor
// (http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/) features. You can
// retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify
// checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks. The following list
// describes the AWS Support case management operations:
//
// * Service names, issue
// categories, and available severity levels. The DescribeServices and
// DescribeSeverityLevels operations return AWS service names, service codes,
// service categories, and problem severity levels. You use these values when you
// call the CreateCase operation.
//
// * Case creation, case details, and case
// resolution. The CreateCase, DescribeCases, DescribeAttachment, and ResolveCase
// operations create AWS Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and
// resolve cases.
//
// * Case communication. The DescribeCommunications,
// AddCommunicationToCase, and AddAttachmentsToSet operations retrieve and add
// communications and attachments to AWS Support cases.
//
// The following list
// describes the operations available from the AWS Support service for Trusted
// Advisor:
//
// * DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks returns the list of checks that run
// against your AWS resources.
//
// * Using the checkId for a specific check returned
// by DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks, you can call DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult
// to obtain the results for the check that you specified.
//
// *
// DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries returns summarized results for one or more
// Trusted Advisor checks.
//
// * RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck requests that Trusted
// Advisor rerun a specified check.
//
// * DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses
// reports the refresh status of one or more checks.
//
// For authentication of
// requests, AWS Support uses Signature Version 4 Signing Process
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html). See
// About the AWS Support API
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html) in the AWS
// Support User Guide for information about how to use this service to create and
// manage your support cases, and how to call Trusted Advisor for results of checks
// on your resources.
