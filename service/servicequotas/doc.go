// Package servicequotas provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for Service Quotas.
//
// Service Quotas is a web service that you can use to manage many of your AWS
// service quotas. Quotas, also referred to as limits, are the maximum values for a
// resource, item, or operation. This guide provide descriptions of the Service
// Quotas actions that you can call from an API. For the Service Quotas user guide,
// which explains how to use Service Quotas from the console, see What is Service
// Quotas (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html).
// AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for programming
// languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc...,). The SDKs
// provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to Service Quotas and
// AWS. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install
// them, see the Tools for Amazon Web Services
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws.amazon.com/tools) page.
