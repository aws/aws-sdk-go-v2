// Package guardduty provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon GuardDuty.
//
// Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and
// processes the following data sources: VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail event logs,
// and DNS logs. It uses threat intelligence feeds (such as lists of malicious IPs
// and domains) and machine learning to identify unexpected, potentially
// unauthorized, and malicious activity within your AWS environment. This can
// include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or
// communication with malicious IPs, URLs, or domains. For example, GuardDuty can
// detect compromised EC2 instances that serve malware or mine bitcoin. GuardDuty
// also monitors AWS account access behavior for signs of compromise. Some examples
// of this are unauthorized infrastructure deployments such as EC2 instances
// deployed in a Region that has never been used, or unusual API calls like a
// password policy change to reduce password strength. GuardDuty informs you of the
// status of your AWS environment by producing security findings that you can view
// in the GuardDuty console or through Amazon CloudWatch events. For more
// information, see the Amazon GuardDuty User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html) .
