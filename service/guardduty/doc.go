// Package guardduty provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon GuardDuty.
//
// Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and
// processes the following data sources: VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail management
// event logs, CloudTrail S3 data event logs, EKS audit logs, and DNS logs. It uses
// threat intelligence feeds (such as lists of malicious IPs and domains) and
// machine learning to identify unexpected, potentially unauthorized, and malicious
// activity within your Amazon Web Services environment. This can include issues
// like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or communication
// with malicious IPs, URLs, or domains. For example, GuardDuty can detect
// compromised EC2 instances that serve malware or mine bitcoin. GuardDuty also
// monitors Amazon Web Services account access behavior for signs of compromise.
// Some examples of this are unauthorized infrastructure deployments such as EC2
// instances deployed in a Region that has never been used, or unusual API calls
// like a password policy change to reduce password strength. GuardDuty informs you
// of the status of your Amazon Web Services environment by producing security
// findings that you can view in the GuardDuty console or through Amazon CloudWatch
// events. For more information, see the Amazon GuardDuty User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html) .
