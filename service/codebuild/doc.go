// Package codebuild provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// AWS CodeBuild.
//
// AWS CodeBuild AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. AWS
// CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts
// that are ready to deploy. AWS CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision,
// manage, and scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged build
// environments for the most popular programming languages and build tools, such as
// Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments
// in AWS CodeBuild to use your own build tools. AWS CodeBuild scales automatically
// to meet peak build requests. You pay only for the build time you consume. For
// more information about AWS CodeBuild, see the AWS CodeBuild User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html).
