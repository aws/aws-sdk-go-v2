	// The current membership status of the member account. The status can have one of

	//   - INVITED - For invited accounts only. Indicates that the member was sent an
	//   invitation but has not yet responded.
	//   - VERIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS - For invited accounts only, indicates that
	//   Detective is verifying that the account identifier and email address provided
	//   for the member account match. If they do match, then Detective sends the
	//   invitation. If the email address and account identifier don't match, then the
	//   member cannot be added to the behavior graph. For organization accounts in the
	//   organization behavior graph, indicates that Detective is verifying that the
	//   account belongs to the organization.
	//   - VERIFICATION_FAILED - For invited accounts only. Indicates that the account
	//   and email address provided for the member account do not match, and Detective
	//   did not send an invitation to the account.
	//   - ENABLED - Indicates that the member account currently contributes data to
	//   the behavior graph. For invited accounts, the member account accepted the
	//   invitation. For organization accounts in the organization behavior graph, the
	//   Detective administrator account enabled the organization account as a member
	//   account.
	//   - ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED - The account accepted the invitation, or was enabled
	//   by the Detective administrator account, but is prevented from contributing data
	//   to the behavior graph. DisabledReason provides the reason why the member
	//   account is not enabled.
	// Invited accounts that declined an invitation or that were removed from the

	// organization accounts that the Detective administrator account did not enable
