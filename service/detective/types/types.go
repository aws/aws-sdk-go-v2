	// For member accounts with a status of ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED, the reason that the
	// member account is not enabled. The reason can have one of the following
	// values:
	//
	//     * VOLUME_TOO_HIGH - Indicates that adding the member account would
	// cause the data volume for the behavior graph to be too high.
	//
	//     *
	// VOLUME_UNKNOWN - Indicates that Detective is unable to verify the data volume
	// for the member account. This is usually because the member account is not
	// enrolled in Amazon GuardDuty.

	// The member account data volume as a percentage of the maximum allowed data
	// volume. 0 indicates 0 percent, and 100 indicates 100 percent. Note that this is

	// volume for the behavior graph is 80 GB per day. The maximum data volume is 160
	// GB per day. If the data volume for the member account is 40 GB per day, then

	//     * VERIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS -
	// Indicates that Detective is verifying that the account identifier and email
	// address provided for the member account match. If they do match, then Detective
	// sends the invitation. If the email address and account identifier don't match,
	// then the member cannot be added to the behavior graph.

	// the member account do not match, and Detective did not send an invitation to the
	// account.
	//
	//     * ENABLED - Indicates that the member account accepted the
	// invitation to contribute to the behavior graph.
	//
	//     * ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED -
	// Indicates that the member account accepted the invitation but is prevented from
	// contributing data to the behavior graph. DisabledReason provides the reason why
	// the member account is not enabled.
	//
	// Member accounts that declined an invitation
