// Sends a request to invite the specified AWS accounts to be member accounts in
// the behavior graph. This operation can only be called by the master account for
// a behavior graph. CreateMembers verifies the accounts and then sends invitations
// to the verified accounts. The request provides the behavior graph ARN and the
// list of accounts to invite. The response separates the requested accounts into
// two lists:
//
//     * The accounts that CreateMembers was able to start the
// verification for. This list includes member accounts that are being verified,
// that have passed verification and are being sent an invitation, and that have
// failed verification.
//
//     * The accounts that CreateMembers was unable to
// process. This list includes accounts that were already invited to be member
// accounts in the behavior graph.
