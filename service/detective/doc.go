// Package detective provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon Detective.
//
// Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help you
// analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web Services (AWS)
// workloads. Detective automatically extracts time-based events such as login
// attempts, API calls, and network traffic from AWS CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual
// Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings detected by
// Amazon GuardDuty. The Detective API primarily supports the creation and
// management of behavior graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from
// a set of member accounts, and is created and managed by a master account. Every
// behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to manage
// graphs that belong to the Region that is associated with the currently selected
// endpoint. A Detective master account can use the Detective API to do the
// following:
//
// * Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new
// behavior graph.
//
// * View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.
//
// * Add
// member accounts to a behavior graph.
//
// * Remove member accounts from a behavior
// graph.
//
// A member account can use the Detective API to do the following:
//
// * View
// the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.
//
// * Accept an invitation to
// contribute to a behavior graph.
//
// * Decline an invitation to contribute to a
// behavior graph.
//
// * Remove their account from a behavior graph.
//
// All API actions
// are logged as CloudTrail events. See Logging Detective API Calls with CloudTrail
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html).
