// Package cloudformation provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS CloudFormation.
//
// AWS CloudFormation AWS CloudFormation allows you to create and manage AWS
// infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. You can use AWS
// CloudFormation to leverage AWS products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud,
// Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple Notification Service, Elastic Load
// Balancing, and Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable,
// cost-effective applications without creating or configuring the underlying AWS
// infrastructure. With AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and
// dependencies in a template file. The template defines a collection of resources
// as a single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates and deletes all
// member resources of the stack together and manages all dependencies between the
// resources for you. For more information about AWS CloudFormation, see the AWS
// CloudFormation Product Page (http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/). Amazon
// CloudFormation makes use of other AWS products. If you need additional technical
// information about a specific AWS product, you can find the product's technical
// documentation at docs.aws.amazon.com (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/).
