// Package iotjobsdataplane provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for AWS IoT Jobs Data Plane.
//
// AWS IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs â€” remote
// operations that are sent to and executed on one or more devices connected to AWS
// IoT. For example, you can define a job that instructs a set of devices to
// download and install application or firmware updates, reboot, rotate
// certificates, or perform remote troubleshooting operations. To create a job, you
// make a job document which is a description of the remote operations to be
// performed, and you specify a list of targets that should perform the operations.
// The targets can be individual things, thing groups or both. AWS IoT Jobs sends a
// message to inform the targets that a job is available. The target starts the
// execution of the job by downloading the job document, performing the operations
// it specifies, and reporting its progress to AWS IoT. The Jobs service provides
// commands to track the progress of a job on a specific target and for all the
// targets of the job
