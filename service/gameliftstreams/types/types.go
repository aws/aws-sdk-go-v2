	//
	//   - PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION : A client has recently disconnected and the
	//   stream session is waiting for the client to reconnect. A client has
	//   ConnectionTimeoutSeconds (specified in StartStreamSession ) from when the
	//   session reaches PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION state to re-establish a
	//   connection. If no client connects within this timeframe, the session
	//   automatically terminates.
	//
	//   - RECONNECTING : A client has initiated a reconnect to a session that was in
	//   PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION state.
	//
	//   - TERMINATING : The stream session is ending.
	//
	//   - TERMINATED : The stream session has ended.
	Status StreamSessionStatus

	// A short description of the reason the stream session is in ERROR status or
	// TERMINATED status.
	//
	// ERROR status reasons:
	//
	//   - applicationLogS3DestinationError : Could not write the application log to
	//   the Amazon S3 bucket that is configured for the streaming application. Make sure
	//   the bucket still exists.
	//
	//   - internalError : An internal service error occurred. Start a new stream
	//   session to continue streaming.
	//
	//   - invalidSignalRequest : The WebRTC signal request that was sent is not valid.
	//   When starting or reconnecting to a stream session, use generateSignalRequest
	//   in the Amazon GameLift Streams Web SDK to generate a new signal request.
	//
	//   - placementTimeout : Amazon GameLift Streams could not find available stream
	//   capacity to start a stream session. Increase the stream capacity in the stream
	//   group or wait until capacity becomes available.
	//
	// TERMINATED status reasons:
	//
	//   - apiTerminated : The stream session was terminated by an API call to [TerminateStreamSession].
	//
	//   - applicationExit : The streaming application exited or crashed. The stream
	//   session was terminated because the application is no longer running.
	//
	//   - connectionTimeout : The stream session was terminated because the client
	//   failed to connect within the connection timeout period specified by
	//   ConnectionTimeoutSeconds .
	//
	//   - idleTimeout : The stream session was terminated because it exceeded the idle
	//   timeout period of 60 minutes with no user input activity.
	//
	//   - maxSessionLengthTimeout : The stream session was terminated because it
	//   exceeded the maximum session length timeout period specified by
	//   SessionLengthSeconds .
	//
	//   - reconnectionTimeout : The stream session was terminated because the client
	//   failed to reconnect within the reconnection timeout period specified by
	//   ConnectionTimeoutSeconds after losing connection.
