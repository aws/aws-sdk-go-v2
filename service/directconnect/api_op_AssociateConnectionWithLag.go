// Associates an existing connection with a link aggregation group (LAG). The
// connection is interrupted and re-established as a member of the LAG
// (connectivity to AWS is interrupted). The connection must be hosted on the same
// AWS Direct Connect endpoint as the LAG, and its bandwidth must match the
// bandwidth for the LAG. You can re-associate a connection that's currently
// associated with a different LAG; however, if removing the connection would cause
// the original LAG to fall below its setting for minimum number of operational
// connections, the request fails. Any virtual interfaces that are directly
// associated with the connection are automatically re-associated with the LAG. If
// the connection was originally associated with a different LAG, the virtual
// interfaces remain associated with the original LAG. For interconnects, any
// hosted connections are automatically re-associated with the LAG. If the
// interconnect was originally associated with a different LAG, the hosted
// connections remain associated with the original LAG.
