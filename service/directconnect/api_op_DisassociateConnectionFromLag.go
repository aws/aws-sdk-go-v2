// Disassociates a connection from a link aggregation group (LAG). The connection
// is interrupted and re-established as a standalone connection (the connection is
// not deleted; to delete the connection, use the DeleteConnection () request). If
// the LAG has associated virtual interfaces or hosted connections, they remain
// associated with the LAG. A disassociated connection owned by an AWS Direct
// Connect Partner is automatically converted to an interconnect. If disassociating
// the connection would cause the LAG to fall below its setting for minimum number
// of operational connections, the request fails, except when it's the last member
// of the LAG. If all connections are disassociated, the LAG continues to exist as
// an empty LAG with no physical connections.
