// rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a
// separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and

	IPSetReferenceStatement *IPSetReferenceStatement

	// A rule statement that defines a string match search against labels that have
	// been added to the web request by rules that have already run in the web ACL. The
	// label match statement provides the label or namespace string to search for. The
	// label string can represent a part or all of the fully qualified label name that

	// optional namespaces, and label name. The prefix identifies the rule group or web

	// A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address,
	// and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a limit that you specify on
	// the number of requests in any 5-minute time span. You can use this to put a
	// temporary block on requests from an IP address that is sending excessive
	// requests. WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a
	// rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based
	// rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a
	// separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and
	// management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then
	// use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of
	// the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by WAF. When the
	// rule action triggers, WAF blocks additional requests from the IP address until
	// the request rate falls below the limit. You can optionally nest another
	// statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so
	// that it only counts requests that match the nested statement. For example, based
	// on recent requests that you have seen from an attacker, you might create a
	// rate-based rule with a nested AND rule statement that contains the following
	// nested statements:
	//
	// * An IP match statement with an IP set that specified the
	// address 192.0.2.44.
	//
	// * A string match statement that searches in the User-Agent
	// header for the string BadBot.
	//
	// In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate
	// limit. For this example, the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet both of the
	// conditions in the statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000 requests
	// per five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet both
	// conditions are not counted towards the rate limit and are not affected by this
	// rule. You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside another statement, for example
	// inside a NotStatement or OrStatement. You can define a RateBasedStatement inside
	// a web ACL and inside a rule group.

	// component matches any of the patterns in the set. To create a regex pattern set,

	RuleGroupReferenceStatement *RuleGroupReferenceStatement

	// A rule statement that compares a number of bytes against the size of a request
	// component, using a comparison operator, such as greater than (>) or less than
	// (<). For example, you can use a size constraint statement to look for query
	// strings that are longer than 100 bytes. If you configure WAF to inspect the
	// request body, WAF inspects only the first 8192 bytes (8 KB). If the request body
	// for your web requests never exceeds 8192 bytes, you can create a size constraint
	// condition and block requests that have a request body greater than 8192 bytes.

	// REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes from the input. REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace
	// each occurrence of a C-style comment (/* ... /) with a single space. Multiple
