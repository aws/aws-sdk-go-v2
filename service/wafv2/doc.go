// Package wafv2 provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// WAFV2.
//
// This is the latest version of the AWS WAF API, released in November, 2019. The
// names of the entities that you use to access this API, like endpoints and
// namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like "V2" or "v2", to
// distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to
// this version, because it has a number of significant improvements. If you used
// AWS WAF prior to this release, you can't use this AWS WAFV2 API to access any
// AWS WAF resources that you created before. You can access your old rules, web
// ACLs, and other AWS WAF resources only through the AWS WAF Classic APIs. The AWS
// WAF Classic APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces. For
// information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF resources to this version,
// see the AWS WAF Developer Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). AWS
// WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS
// requests that are forwarded to Amazon CloudFront, an Amazon API Gateway API, or
// an Application Load Balancer. AWS WAF also lets you control access to your
// content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that
// requests originate from or the values of query strings, API Gateway, CloudFront,
// or the Application Load Balancer responds to requests either with the requested
// content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You also can configure
// CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked. This API
// guide is for developers who need detailed information about AWS WAF API actions,
// data types, and errors. For detailed information about AWS WAF features and an
// overview of how to use AWS WAF, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/). You can make calls
// using the endpoints listed in AWS Service Endpoints for AWS WAF
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#waf_region).
//
//     *
// For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the list. A
// regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or an API Gateway
// stage.
//
//     * For AWS CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint
// listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.
//
// Alternatively, you can use one of
// the AWS SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or
// platform that you're using. For more information, see AWS SDKs
// (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs). We currently provide two versions of the
// AWS WAF API: this API and the prior versions, the classic AWS WAF APIs. This new
// API provides the same functionality as the older versions, with the following
// major improvements:
//
//     * You use one API for both global and regional
// applications. Where you need to distinguish the scope, you specify a Scope
// parameter and set it to CLOUDFRONT or REGIONAL.
//
//     * You can define a Web ACL
// or rule group with a single call, and update it with a single call. You define
// all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass them to your rule group or Web
// ACL calls.
//
//     * The limits AWS WAF places on the use of rules more closely
// reflects the cost of running each type of rule. Rule groups include capacity
// settings, so you know the maximum cost of a rule group when you use it.
