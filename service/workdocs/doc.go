// Package workdocs provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon WorkDocs.
//
// The WorkDocs API is designed for the following use cases:
//
// * File Migration:
// File migration applications are supported for users who want to migrate their
// files from an on-premises or off-premises file system or service. Users can
// insert files into a user directory structure, as well as allow for basic
// metadata changes, such as modifications to the permissions of files.
//
// *
// Security: Support security applications are supported for users who have
// additional security needs, such as antivirus or data loss prevention. The API
// actions, along with AWS CloudTrail, allow these applications to detect when
// changes occur in Amazon WorkDocs. Then, the application can take the necessary
// actions and replace the target file. If the target file violates the policy, the
// application can also choose to email the user.
//
// * eDiscovery/Analytics: General
// administrative applications are supported, such as eDiscovery and analytics.
// These applications can choose to mimic or record the actions in an Amazon
// WorkDocs site, along with AWS CloudTrail, to replicate data for eDiscovery,
// backup, or analytical applications.
//
// All Amazon WorkDocs API actions are Amazon
// authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the use of the AWS
// SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of IAM users and roles to help
// facilitate access, trust, and permission policies. By creating a role and
// allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon WorkDocs site, the IAM user gains full
// administrative visibility into the entire Amazon WorkDocs site (or as set in the
// IAM policy). This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to modify file
// permissions and upload any file to any user. This allows developers to perform
// the three use cases above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on
// a selective basis using the IAM model.
