// Package cognitoidentityprovider provides the API client, operations, and
// parameter types for Amazon Cognito Identity Provider.
//
// With the Amazon Cognito user pools API, you can set up user pools and app
// clients, and authenticate users. To authenticate users from third-party identity
// providers (IdPs) in this API, you can link IdP users to native user profiles (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-identity-federation-consolidate-users.html)
// . Learn more about the authentication and authorization of federated users in
// the Using the Amazon Cognito user pools API and user pool endpoints (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-userpools-server-contract-reference.html)
// . This API reference provides detailed information about API operations and
// object types in Amazon Cognito. At the bottom of the page for each API operation
// and object, under See Also, you can learn how to use it in an Amazon Web
// Services SDK in the language of your choice. Along with resource management
// operations, the Amazon Cognito user pools API includes classes of operations and
// authorization models for client-side and server-side user operations. For more
// information, see Using the Amazon Cognito native and OIDC APIs (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pools-API-operations.html)
// in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide. You can also start reading about the
// CognitoIdentityProvider client in the following SDK guides.
