// Package marketplacemetering provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for AWSMarketplace Metering.
//
// AWS Marketplace Metering Service This reference provides descriptions of the
// low-level AWS Marketplace Metering Service API. AWS Marketplace sellers can use
// this API to submit usage data for custom usage dimensions. For information on
// the permissions you need to use this API, see AWS Marketplace metering and
// entitlement API permissions
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/iam-user-policy-for-aws-marketplace-actions.html)
// in the AWS Marketplace Seller Guide. Submitting Metering Records
//
// * MeterUsage -
// Submits the metering record for an AWS Marketplace product. MeterUsage is called
// from an EC2 instance or a container running on EKS or ECS.
//
// * BatchMeterUsage -
// Submits the metering record for a set of customers. BatchMeterUsage is called
// from a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application.
//
// # Accepting New Customers
//
// *
// ResolveCustomer - Called by a SaaS application during the registration process.
// When a buyer visits your website during the registration process, the buyer
// submits a Registration Token through the browser. The Registration Token is
// resolved through this API to obtain a CustomerIdentifier along with the
// CustomerAWSAccountId and ProductCode.
//
// Entitlement and Metering for Paid
// Container Products
//
// * Paid container software products sold through AWS
// Marketplace must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call
// the RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL
// products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call RegisterUsage, but
// you can do so if you want to receive usage data in your seller reports. For more
// information on using the RegisterUsage operation, see Container-Based Products
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html).
//
// BatchMeterUsage
// API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail to verify that
// the SaaS metering records that you sent are accurate by searching for records
// with the eventName of BatchMeterUsage. You can also use CloudTrail to audit
// records over time. For more information, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide
// (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html).
