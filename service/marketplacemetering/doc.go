// Package marketplacemetering provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for AWSMarketplace Metering.
//
// AWS Marketplace Metering Service This reference provides descriptions of the
// low-level AWS Marketplace Metering Service API. AWS Marketplace sellers can use
// this API to submit usage data for custom usage dimensions. For information on
// the permissions you need to use this API, see AWS Marketplace metering and
// entitlement API permissions (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/iam-user-policy-for-aws-marketplace-actions.html)
// in the AWS Marketplace Seller Guide. Submitting Metering Records
//   - MeterUsage - Submits the metering record for an AWS Marketplace product.
//     MeterUsage is called from an EC2 instance or a container running on EKS or
//     ECS.
//   - BatchMeterUsage - Submits the metering record for a set of customers.
//     BatchMeterUsage is called from a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application.
//
// Accepting New Customers
//   - ResolveCustomer - Called by a SaaS application during the registration
//     process. When a buyer visits your website during the registration process, the
//     buyer submits a Registration Token through the browser. The Registration Token
//     is resolved through this API to obtain a CustomerIdentifier along with the
//     CustomerAWSAccountId and ProductCode .
//
// Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products
//   - Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must
//     integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the RegisterUsage
//     operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for
//     Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call RegisterUsage , but you can
//     do so if you want to receive usage data in your seller reports. For more
//     information on using the RegisterUsage operation, see Container-Based Products (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html)
//     .
//
// BatchMeterUsage API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use
// Cloudtrail to verify that the SaaS metering records that you sent are accurate
// by searching for records with the eventName of BatchMeterUsage . You can also
// use CloudTrail to audit records over time. For more information, see the AWS
// CloudTrail User Guide (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html)
// .
