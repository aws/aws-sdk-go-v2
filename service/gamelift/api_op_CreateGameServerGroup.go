// This action is part of Amazon GameLift FleetIQ with game server groups, which is
// in preview release and is subject to change. Creates a GameLift FleetIQ game
// server group to manage a collection of EC2 instances for game hosting. In
// addition to creating the game server group, this action also creates an Auto
// Scaling group in your AWS account and establishes a link between the two groups.
// You have full control over configuration of the Auto Scaling group, but GameLift
// FleetIQ routinely certain Auto Scaling group properties in order to optimize the
// group's instances for low-cost game hosting. You can view the status of your
// game server groups in the GameLift Console. Game server group metrics and events
// are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch. Prior creating a new game server group, you
// must set up the following:
//
//     * An EC2 launch template. The template provides
// configuration settings for a set of EC2 instances and includes the game server
// build that you want to deploy and run on each instance. For more information on
// creating a launch template, see  Launching an Instance from a Launch Template
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html)
// in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.
//
//     * An IAM role. The role sets up limited
// access to your AWS account, allowing GameLift FleetIQ to create and manage the
// EC2 Auto Scaling group, get instance data, and emit metrics and events to
// CloudWatch. For more information on setting up an IAM permissions policy with
// principal access for GameLift, see  Specifying a Principal in a Policy
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-bucket-user-policy-specifying-principal-intro.html)
// in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.
//
// To create a new game server group, provide a
// name and specify the IAM role and EC2 launch template. You also need to provide
// a list of instance types to be used in the group and set initial maximum and
// minimum limits on the group's instance count. You can optionally set an
// autoscaling policy with target tracking based on a GameLift FleetIQ metric. Once
// the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you have
// full access to change the Auto Scaling group's configuration as needed. Keep in
// mind, however, that some properties are periodically updated by GameLift FleetIQ
// as it balances the group's instances based on availability and cost. Learn more
// GameLift FleetIQ Guide
