// Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom
// matchmaking rules, and starts a new game for the matched players. Each
// matchmaking request specifies the type of match to build (team configuration,
// rules for an acceptable match, etc.). The request also specifies the players to
// find a match for and where to host the new game session for optimal performance.
// A matchmaking request might start with a single player or a group of players who
// want to play together. FlexMatch finds additional players as needed to fill the
// match. Match type, rules, and the queue used to place a new game session are
// defined in a MatchmakingConfiguration. To start matchmaking, provide a unique
// ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be
// matched. You must also include a set of player attributes relevant for the
// matchmaking configuration. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with
// status set to QUEUED. Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed and
// acquire game session connection information for successfully completed matches.
// Tracking ticket status -- A couple of options are available for tracking the
// status of matchmaking requests:
//
//     * Polling -- Call DescribeMatchmaking. This
// operation returns the full ticket object, including current status and (for
// completed tickets) game session connection info. We recommend polling no more
// than once every 10 seconds.
//
//     * Notifications -- Get event notifications for
// changes in ticket status using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS).
// Notifications are easy to set up (see CreateMatchmakingConfiguration ()) and
// typically deliver match status changes faster and more efficiently than polling.
// We recommend that you use polling to back up to notifications (since delivery is
// not guaranteed) and call DescribeMatchmaking only when notifications are not
// received within 30 seconds.
//
// Processing a matchmaking request -- FlexMatch
// handles a matchmaking request as follows:
//
//     * Your client code submits a
// StartMatchmaking request for one or more players and tracks the status of the
// request ticket.
//
//     * FlexMatch uses this ticket and others in process to build
// an acceptable match. When a potential match is identified, all tickets in the
// proposed match are advanced to the next status.
//
//     * If the match requires
// player acceptance (set in the matchmaking configuration), the tickets move into
// status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE. This status triggers your client code to solicit
// acceptance from all players in every ticket involved in the match, and then call
// AcceptMatch () for each player. If any player rejects or fails to accept the
// match before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped (see AcceptMatch
// for more details).
//
//     * Once a match is proposed and accepted, the matchmaking
// tickets move into status PLACING. FlexMatch locates resources for a new game
// session using the game session queue (set in the matchmaking configuration) and
// creates the game session based on the match data.
//
//     * When the match is
// successfully placed, the matchmaking tickets move into COMPLETED status.
// Connection information (including game session endpoint and player session) is
// added to the matchmaking tickets. Matched players can use the connection
// information to join the game.
