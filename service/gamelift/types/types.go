	// * FLEET_STATE_DOWNLOADING
	// -- Fleet status changed from NEW to DOWNLOADING. The compressed build has
	// started downloading to a fleet instance for installation.
	//
	// *
	// FLEET_BINARY_DOWNLOAD_FAILED -- The build failed to download to the fleet
	// instance.
	//
	// * FLEET_CREATION_EXTRACTING_BUILD – The game server build was
	// successfully downloaded to an instance, and the build files are now being
	// extracted from the uploaded build and saved to an instance. Failure at this
	// stage prevents a fleet from moving to ACTIVE status. Logs for this stage display
	// a list of the files that are extracted and saved on the instance. Access the

	//
	// * FLEET_CREATION_RUNNING_INSTALLER –

	// which are specified in the fleet's runtime configuration, exist. If any listed
	// launch path exists, Amazon GameLift tries to launch a game server process and

	// from moving to ACTIVE status. Logs for this stage list the launch paths in the
	// runtime configuration and indicate whether each is found. Access the logs by
	// using the URL in PreSignedLogUrl.
	//
	// * FLEET_STATE_VALIDATING -- Fleet status
	// changed from DOWNLOADING to VALIDATING.
	//
	// *
	// FLEET_VALIDATION_LAUNCH_PATH_NOT_FOUND -- Validation of the runtime
	// configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path does not
	// exist on the instance.
	//
	// * FLEET_STATE_BUILDING -- Fleet status changed from
	// VALIDATING to BUILDING.
	//
	// * FLEET_VALIDATION_EXECUTABLE_RUNTIME_FAILURE --
	// Validation of the runtime configuration failed because the executable specified
	// in a launch path failed to run on the fleet instance.
	//
	// * FLEET_STATE_ACTIVATING
	// -- Fleet status changed from BUILDING to ACTIVATING.
	//
	// * FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED
	// - The fleet failed to successfully complete one of the steps in the fleet
	// activation process. This event code indicates that the game build was
	// successfully downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and validated, but was not
	// able to start a server process. Learn more at  Debug Fleet Creation Issues
	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-creating-debug.html#fleets-creating-debug-creation)

	// *
	// FLEET_VPC_PEERING_SUCCEEDED -- A VPC peering connection has been established
	// between the VPC for an Amazon GameLift fleet and a VPC in your AWS account.
	//
	// *
	// FLEET_VPC_PEERING_FAILED -- A requested VPC peering connection has failed. Event
	// details and status information (see DescribeVpcPeeringConnections) provide
	// additional detail. A common reason for peering failure is that the two VPCs have
	// overlapping CIDR blocks of IPv4 addresses. To resolve this, change the CIDR
