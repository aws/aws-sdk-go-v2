// Package computeoptimizer provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for AWS Compute Optimizer.
//
// AWS Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and
// utilization metrics of your AWS resources, such as EC2 instances and Auto
// Scaling groups. It reports whether your resources are optimal, and generates
// optimization recommendations to reduce the cost and improve the performance of
// your workloads. Compute Optimizer also provides recent utilization metric data,
// as well as projected utilization metric data for the recommendations, which you
// can use to evaluate which recommendation provides the best price-performance
// trade-off. The analysis of your usage patterns can help you decide when to move
// or resize your running resources, and still meet your performance and capacity
// requirements. For more information about Compute Optimizer, including the
// required permissions to use the service, see the AWS Compute Optimizer User
// Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/).
