// PutRuleRequest returns a request value for making API operation for
// Amazon EventBridge.
//
// Creates or updates the specified rule. Rules are enabled by default or based
// on value of the state. You can disable a rule using DisableRule.
//
// A single rule watches for events from a single event bus. Events generated
// by AWS services go to your account's default event bus. Events generated
// by SaaS partner services or applications go to the matching partner event
// bus. If you have custom applications or services, you can specify whether
// their events go to your default event bus or a custom event bus that you
// have created. For more information, see CreateEventBus.
//
// If you're updating an existing rule, the rule is replaced with what you specify
// in this PutRule command. If you omit arguments in PutRule, the old values
// for those arguments aren't kept. Instead, they're replaced with null values.
//
// When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately start
// matching to new or updated rules. Allow a short period of time for changes
// to take effect.
//
// A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression. Rules
// with EventPatterns are triggered when a matching event is observed. Rules
// with ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule
// can have both an EventPattern and a ScheduleExpression, in which case the
// rule triggers on matching events as well as on a schedule.
//
// When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more tags
// to the rule. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You
// can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission
// to access or change only rules with certain tag values. To use the PutRule
// operation and assign tags, you must have both the events:PutRule and events:TagResource
// permissions.
//
// If you are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the PutRule
// operation are ignored. To update the tags of an existing rule, use TagResource
// and UntagResource.
//
// Most services in AWS treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource
// Names (ARNs). However, EventBridge uses an exact match in event patterns
// and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event
// patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event that you want to
// match.
//
// In EventBridge, you could create rules that lead to infinite loops, where
// a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have
// changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the desired
// state. If you don't write the rule carefully, the subsequent change to the
// ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite loop.
//
// To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions don't refire
// the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to
// be in a bad state, instead of after any change.
//
// An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend
// that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed your specified
// limit. For more information, see Managing Your Costs with Budgets (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/budgets-managing-costs.html).
