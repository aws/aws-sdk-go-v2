// Package ebs provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for Amazon
// Elastic Block Store.
//
// You can use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) direct APIs to directly read
// the data on your EBS snapshots, and identify the difference between two
// snapshots. You can view the details of blocks in an EBS snapshot, compare the
// block difference between two snapshots, and directly access the data in a
// snapshot. If you're an independent software vendor (ISV) who offers backup
// services for EBS, the EBS direct APIs make it easier and more cost-effective to
// track incremental changes on your EBS volumes via EBS snapshots. This can be
// done without having to create new volumes from EBS snapshots. This API reference
// provides detailed information about the actions, data types, parameters, and
// errors of the EBS direct APIs. For more information about the elements that make
// up the EBS direct APIs, and examples of how to use them effectively, see
// Accessing the Contents of an EBS Snapshot
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-accessing-snapshot.html)
// in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. For more information about the
// supported AWS Regions, endpoints, and service quotas for the EBS direct APIs,
// see Amazon Elastic Block Store Endpoints and Quotas
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ebs-service.html) in the AWS
// General Reference.
