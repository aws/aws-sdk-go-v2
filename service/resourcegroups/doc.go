// Package resourcegroups provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS Resource Groups.
//
// AWS Resource Groups AWS Resource Groups lets you organize AWS resources such as
// Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Relational Database Service databases, and Amazon
// S3 buckets into groups using criteria that you define as tags. A resource group
// is a collection of resources that match the resource types specified in a query,
// and share one or more tags or portions of tags. You can create a group of
// resources based on their roles in your cloud infrastructure, lifecycle stages,
// regions, application layers, or virtually any criteria. Resource groups enable
// you to automate management tasks, such as those in AWS Systems Manager
// Automation documents, on tag-related resources in AWS Systems Manager. Groups of
// tagged resources also let you quickly view a custom console in AWS Systems
// Manager that shows AWS Config compliance and other monitoring data about member
// resources. To create a resource group, build a resource query, and specify tags
// that identify the criteria that members of the group have in common. Tags are
// key-value pairs. For more information about Resource Groups, see the AWS
// Resource Groups User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/welcome.html). AWS Resource
// Groups uses a REST-compliant API that you can use to perform the following types
// of operations.
//
//     * Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on
// resource groups and resource query entities
//
//     * Applying, editing, and
// removing tags from resource groups
//
//     * Resolving resource group member ARNs
// so they can be returned as search results
//
//     * Getting data about resources
// that are members of a group
//
//     * Searching AWS resources based on a resource
// query
