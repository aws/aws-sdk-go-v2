// Package pricing provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Price List Service.
//
// Amazon Web Services Price List API is a centralized and convenient way to
// programmatically query Amazon Web Services for services, products, and pricing
// information. The Amazon Web Services Price List uses standardized product
// attributes such as Location, Storage Class, and Operating System, and provides
// prices at the SKU level. You can use the Amazon Web Services Price List to build
// cost control and scenario planning tools, reconcile billing data, forecast
// future spend for budgeting purposes, and provide cost benefit analysis that
// compare your internal workloads with Amazon Web Services. Use GetServices
// without a service code to retrieve the service codes for all AWS services, then
// GetServices with a service code to retrieve the attribute names for that
// service. After you have the service code and attribute names, you can use
// GetAttributeValues to see what values are available for an attribute. With the
// service code and an attribute name and value, you can use GetProducts to find
// specific products that you're interested in, such as an AmazonEC2 instance, with
// a Provisioned IOPSvolumeType. Service Endpoint Amazon Web Services Price List
// service API provides the following two endpoints:
