// Package savingsplans provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS Savings Plans.
//
// Savings Plans are a pricing model that offer significant savings on AWS usage
// (for example, on Amazon EC2 instances). You commit to a consistent amount of
// usage, in USD per hour, for a term of 1 or 3 years, and receive a lower price
// for that usage. For more information, see the AWS Savings Plans User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/).
