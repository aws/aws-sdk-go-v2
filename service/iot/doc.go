// Package iot provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// IoT.
//
// AWS IoT AWS IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between
// Internet-connected devices (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or
// smart appliances) and the AWS cloud. You can discover your custom IoT-Data
// endpoint to communicate with, configure rules for data processing and
// integration with other services, organize resources associated with each device
// (Registry), configure logging, and create and manage policies and credentials to
// authenticate devices. The service endpoints that expose this API are listed in
// AWS IoT Core Endpoints and Quotas
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html). You must use the
// endpoint for the region that has the resources you want to access. The service
// name used by AWS Signature Version 4
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) to sign
// the request is: execute-api. For more information about how AWS IoT works, see
// the Developer Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/aws-iot-how-it-works.html).
// For information about how to use the credentials provider for AWS IoT, see
// Authorizing Direct Calls to AWS Services
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/authorizing-direct-aws.html).
