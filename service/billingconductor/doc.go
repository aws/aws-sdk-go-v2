// version of your billing data each month, to accurately show or chargeback your
// end customers. Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor doesn't change the way
// you're billed by Amazon Web Services each month by design. Instead, it provides
// you with a mechanism to configure, generate, and display rates to certain
// customers over a given billing period. You can also analyze the difference
// between the rates you apply to your accounting groupings relative to your actual
// rates from Amazon Web Services. As a result of your Amazon Web Services Billing
// Conductor configuration, the payer account can also see the custom rate applied
// on the billing details page of the Amazon Web Services Billing console
// (https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing), or configure a cost and usage report
// per billing group. This documentation shows how you can configure Amazon Web
// Services Billing Conductor using its API. For more information about using the
// Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor
// (https://console.aws.amazon.com/enterprisebilling/) user interface, see the
// Amazon Web Services Enterprise Billing Console User Guide
