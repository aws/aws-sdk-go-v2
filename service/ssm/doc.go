// Package ssm provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for Amazon
// Simple Systems Manager (SSM).
//
// AWS Systems Manager AWS Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities that
// helps you automate management tasks such as collecting system inventory,
// applying operating system (OS) patches, automating the creation of Amazon
// Machine Images (AMIs), and configuring operating systems (OSs) and applications
// at scale. Systems Manager lets you remotely and securely manage the
// configuration of your managed instances. A managed instance is any Amazon
// Elastic Compute Cloud instance (EC2 instance), or any on-premises server or
// virtual machine (VM) in your hybrid environment that has been configured for
// Systems Manager. This reference is intended to be used with the AWS Systems
// Manager User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/). To get started,
// verify prerequisites and configure managed instances. For more information, see
// Setting up AWS Systems Manager
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-setting-up.html)
// in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. For information about other API actions
// you can perform on EC2 instances, see the Amazon EC2 API Reference
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/). For information about
// how to use a Query API, see Making API requests
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/making-api-requests.html).
