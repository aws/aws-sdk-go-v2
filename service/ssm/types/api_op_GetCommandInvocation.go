	//
	//    * Pending: The command has not been sent to the instance.
	//
	//    * In Progress: The command has been sent to the instance but has not reached
	//    a terminal state.
	//
	//    * Delayed: The system attempted to send the command to the target, but
	//    the target was not available. The instance might not be available because
	//    of network issues, the instance was stopped, etc. The system will try
	//    to deliver the command again.
	//
	//    * Success: The command or plugin was run successfully. This is a terminal
	//    state.
	//
	//    * Delivery Timed Out: The command was not delivered to the instance before
	//    the delivery timeout expired. Delivery timeouts do not count against the
	//    parent command's MaxErrors limit, but they do contribute to whether the
	//    parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.
	//
	//    * Execution Timed Out: The command started to run on the instance, but
	//    the execution was not complete before the timeout expired. Execution timeouts
	//    count against the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal
	//    state.
	//
	//    * Failed: The command wasn't run successfully on the instance. For a plugin,
	//    this indicates that the result code was not zero. For a command invocation,
	//    this indicates that the result code for one or more plugins was not zero.
	//    Invocation failures count against the MaxErrors limit of the parent command.
	//    This is a terminal state.
	//
	//    * Canceled: The command was terminated before it was completed. This is
	//    a terminal state.
	//
	//    * Undeliverable: The command can't be delivered to the instance. The instance
	//    might not exist or might not be responding. Undeliverable invocations
	//    don't count against the parent command's MaxErrors limit and don't contribute
	//    to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is
	//    a terminal state.
	//
	//    * Terminated: The parent command exceeded its MaxErrors limit and subsequent
	//    command invocations were canceled by the system. This is a terminal state.
