	Status types.CommandInvocationStatus

	// A detailed status of the command execution for an invocation. StatusDetails

	// Understanding command statuses
	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/monitor-commands.html)
	// in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. StatusDetails can be one of the following
	// values:
	//
	// * Pending: The command has not been sent to the instance.
	//
	// * In
	// Progress: The command has been sent to the instance but has not reached a
	// terminal state.
	//
	// * Delayed: The system attempted to send the command to the
	// target, but the target was not available. The instance might not be available
	// because of network issues, because the instance was stopped, or for similar
	// reasons. The system will try to send the command again.
	//
	// * Success: The command
	// or plugin ran successfully. This is a terminal state.
	//
	// * Delivery Timed Out: The
	// command was not delivered to the instance before the delivery timeout expired.
	// Delivery timeouts do not count against the parent command's MaxErrors limit, but
	// they do contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or
	// Incomplete. This is a terminal state.
	//
	// * Execution Timed Out: The command
	// started to run on the instance, but the execution was not complete before the
	// timeout expired. Execution timeouts count against the MaxErrors limit of the
	// parent command. This is a terminal state.
	//
	// * Failed: The command wasn't run
	// successfully on the instance. For a plugin, this indicates that the result code
	// was not zero. For a command invocation, this indicates that the result code for
	// one or more plugins was not zero. Invocation failures count against the
	// MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.
	//
	// * Canceled:
	// The command was terminated before it was completed. This is a terminal state.
	//
	// *
	// Undeliverable: The command can't be delivered to the instance. The instance
	// might not exist or might not be responding. Undeliverable invocations don't
	// count against the parent command's MaxErrors limit and don't contribute to
	// whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal
	// state.
	//
	// * Terminated: The parent command exceeded its MaxErrors limit and
	// subsequent command invocations were canceled by the system. This is a terminal
	// state.
	StatusDetails *string

	// Metadata pertaining to the operation's result.
