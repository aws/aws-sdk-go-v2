// events.

// The Health API requires a Business or Enterprise support plan
// from AWS Support (http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/). Calling the Health API
// from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise support plan causes
// a SubscriptionRequiredException. For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses
// the Signature Version 4 Signing Process
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html). See
// the AWS Health User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/what-is-aws-health.html) for
// information about how to use the API. Service Endpoint The HTTP endpoint for the
// AWS Health API is:
//
//     * https://health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
