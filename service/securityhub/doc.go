// Package securityhub provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// AWS SecurityHub.
//
// Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of the security state of
// your Amazon Web Services environment and resources. It also provides you with
// the readiness status of your environment based on controls from supported
// security standards. Security Hub collects security data from Amazon Web Services
// accounts, services, and integrated third-party products and helps you analyze
// security trends in your environment to identify the highest priority security
// issues. For more information about Security Hub, see the  Security HubUser Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html).
// When you use operations in the Security Hub API, the requests are executed only
// in the Amazon Web Services Region that is currently active or in the specific
// Amazon Web Services Region that you specify in your request. Any configuration
// or settings change that results from the operation is applied only to that
// Region. To make the same change in other Regions, execute the same command for
// each Region to apply the change to. For example, if your Region is set to
// us-west-2, when you use CreateMembers to add a member account to Security Hub,
// the association of the member account with the administrator account is created
// only in the us-west-2 Region. Security Hub must be enabled for the member
// account in the same Region that the invitation was sent from. The following
// throttling limits apply to using Security Hub API operations.
//
// *
// BatchEnableStandards - RateLimit of 1 request per second, BurstLimit of 1
// request per second.
//
// * GetFindings - RateLimit of 3 requests per second.
// BurstLimit of 6 requests per second.
//
// * BatchImportFindings - RateLimit of 10
// requests per second. BurstLimit of 30 requests per second.
//
// *
// BatchUpdateFindings - RateLimit of 10 requests per second. BurstLimit of 30
// requests per second.
//
// * UpdateStandardsControl - RateLimit of 1 request per
// second, BurstLimit of 5 requests per second.
//
// * All other operations - RateLimit
// of 10 requests per second. BurstLimit of 30 requests per second.
