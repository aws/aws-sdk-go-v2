	// * To search for values that exactly match the filter
	// value, use EQUALS. For example, the filter ResourceType EQUALS
	// AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings that have a resource type of
	// AwsEc2SecurityGroup.
	//
	// * To search for values that start with the filter value,
	// use PREFIX. For example, the filter ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings
	// that have a resource type that starts with AwsIam. Findings with a resource type
	// of AwsIamPolicy, AwsIamRole, or AwsIamUser would all match.
	//
	// EQUALS and PREFIX
	// filters on the same field are joined by OR. A finding matches if it matches any
	// one of those filters. To search for values that do not contain the filter
	// criteria value, use one of the following comparison operators:
	//
	// * To search for
	// values that do not exactly match the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS. For example,
	// the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy matches findings that have a
	// resource type other than AwsIamPolicy.
	//
	// * To search for values that do not start
	// with the filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS. For example, the filter
	// ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings that have a resource type
	// that does not start with AwsIam. Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy,
	// AwsIamRole, or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from the results.
	//
	// NOT_EQUALS
	// and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND. A finding
	// matches only if it matches all of those filters. For filters on the same field,
	// you cannot provide both an EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
	// filter. Combining filters in this way always returns an error, even if the
	// provided filter values would return valid results. You can combine PREFIX
	// filters with NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.
	// Security Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS or
	// PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters. For example, for the following filter, Security Hub
	// first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either AwsIAM
	// or AwsEc2. It then excludes findings that have a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
	// and findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface.
