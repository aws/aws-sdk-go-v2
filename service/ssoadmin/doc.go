// Package ssoadmin provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// AWS Single Sign-On Admin.
//
// AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) helps you securely
// create, or connect, your workforce identities and manage their access centrally
// across AWS accounts and applications. IAM Identity Center is the recommended
// approach for workforce authentication and authorization in AWS, for
// organizations of any size and type. Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the
// sso and identitystore API namespaces will continue to retain their original name
// for backward compatibility purposes. For more information, see IAM Identity
// Center rename
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed).
// This reference guide provides information on single sign-on operations which
// could be used for access management of AWS accounts. For information about IAM
// Identity Center features, see the IAM Identity Center User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html). Many
// operations in the IAM Identity Center APIs rely on identifiers for users and
// groups, known as principals. For more information about how to work with
// principals and principal IDs in IAM Identity Center, see the Identity Store API
// Reference
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/IdentityStoreAPIReference/welcome.html).
// AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
// programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, and more).
// The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM Identity
// Center and other AWS services. For more information about the AWS SDKs,
// including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services
// (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
