// Package ssoadmin provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// AWS Single Sign-On Admin.
//
// Amazon Web Services Single Sign On (SSO) is a cloud SSO service that makes it
// easy to centrally manage SSO access to multiple Amazon Web Services accounts and
// business applications. This guide provides information on SSO operations which
// could be used for access management of Amazon Web Services accounts. For
// information about Amazon Web Services SSO features, see the Amazon Web Services
// Single Sign-On User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html). Many
// operations in the SSO APIs rely on identifiers for users and groups, known as
// principals. For more information about how to work with principals and principal
// IDs in Amazon Web Services SSO, see the Amazon Web Services SSO Identity Store
// API Reference
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/IdentityStoreAPIReference/welcome.html).
