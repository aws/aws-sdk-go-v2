	// object that is transferred and integrity checked.
	LogLevel LogLevel

	// A value that indicates the last time that a file was modified (that is, a file
	// was written to) before the PREPARING phase. This option is required for cases
	// when you need to run the same task more than one time. Default Value: PRESERVE
	// PRESERVE: Preserve original Mtime (recommended) NONE: Ignore Mtime. If Mtime is
	// set to PRESERVE, Atime must be set to BEST_EFFORT. If Mtime is set to NONE,
	// Atime must also be set to NONE.

	// A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten
	// or preserved when copying files. If set to NEVER a destination file will not be
	// replaced by a source file, even if the destination file differs from the source
	// file. If you modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you can use
	// this value to protect against overwriting those changes. Some storage classes
	// have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost. For detailed
	// information, see Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in
	// DataSync

	// A value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific

	// metadata is copied by DataSync, see Metadata Copied by DataSync
	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied).
	// Default value: PRESERVE. PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions
	// (recommended). NONE: Ignore permissions. DataSync can preserve extant
	// permissions of a source location.
	PosixPermissions PosixPermissions

	// A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the
	// source file system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage
	// cost. If your task deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration
	// charges for certain storage classes. For detailed information, see

	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes)

	// destination files (recommended). REMOVE: Delete destination files that aren’t
	// present in the source.
	PreserveDeletedFiles PreserveDeletedFiles

	// A value that determines whether DataSync should preserve the metadata of block
	// and character devices in the source file system, and re-create the files with
	// that device name and metadata on the destination. DataSync does not copy the
	// contents of such devices, only the name and metadata. DataSync can't sync the
	// actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal and don't return
	// an end-of-file (EOF) marker. Default value: NONE. NONE: Ignore special devices
	// (recommended). PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This
	// option isn't currently supported for Amazon EFS.
	PreserveDevices PreserveDevices

	// A value that determines which components of the SMB security descriptor are
	// copied from source to destination objects. This value is only used for transfers
	// between SMB and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations, or between two
	// Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations. For more information about how
	// DataSync handles metadata, see How DataSync Handles Metadata and Special Files
	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html).
	// Default value: OWNER_DACL. OWNER_DACL: For each copied object, DataSync copies
	// the following metadata:
	//
	// * Object owner.
	//
	// * NTFS discretionary access control
	// lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object.
	//
	// When
	// choosing this option, DataSync does NOT copy the NTFS system access control
	// lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a
	// secured object. OWNER_DACL_SACL: For each copied object, DataSync copies the
	// following metadata:
	//
	// * Object owner.
	//
	// * NTFS discretionary access control lists
	// (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object.
	//
	// * NTFS system
	// access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts
	// to access a secured object.
	//
	// Copying SACLs requires granting additional
	// permissions to the Windows user that DataSync uses to access your SMB location.
	// For information about choosing a user that ensures sufficient permissions to
	// files, folders, and metadata, see user. NONE: None of the SMB security
	// descriptor components are copied. Destination objects are owned by the user that
	// was provided for accessing the destination location. DACLs and SACLs are set
	// based on the destination server’s configuration.
	SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags SmbSecurityDescriptorCopyFlags

	// A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the
	// tasks. If set to ENABLED, the tasks will be queued. The default is ENABLED. If
	// you use the same agent to run multiple tasks, you can enable the tasks to run in
	// series. For more information, see Queueing task executions
	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/run-task.html#queue-task-execution).
	TaskQueueing TaskQueueing

	// A value that determines whether DataSync transfers only the data and metadata
	// that differ between the source and the destination location, or whether DataSync
	// transfers all the content from the source, without comparing to the destination
	// location. CHANGED: DataSync copies only data or metadata that is new or
	// different content from the source location to the destination location. ALL:
	// DataSync copies all source location content to the destination, without
	// comparing to existing content on the destination.
	TransferMode TransferMode

	// The POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner. This option should only be set for

	// Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID (GID) (recommended). NONE: Ignore
	// UID and GID.
	Uid Uid

	// A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be
	// performed at the end of a task execution after all data and metadata have been
	// transferred. For more information, see Configure task settings
	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-task.html).
	// Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT. ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended):
	// Perform verification only on files that were transferred.
	// POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Scan the entire source and entire destination at the
	// end of the transfer to verify that source and destination are fully
	// synchronized. This option isn't supported when transferring to S3 Glacier
	// Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes. NONE: No
	// additional verification is done at the end of the transfer, but all data
	// transmissions are integrity-checked with checksum verification during the
	// transfer.
