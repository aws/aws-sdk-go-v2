	// the version before the PREPARING phase). However, Atime's behavior is not fully
	// standard across platforms, so AWS DataSync can only do this on a best-effort
	// basis. Default value: BEST_EFFORT. BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file
	// Atime value (recommended). NONE: Ignore Atime. If Atime is set to BEST_EFFORT,
	// Mtime must be set to PRESERVE. If Atime is set to NONE, Mtime must also be NONE.
	Atime Atime

	// A value that indicates the last time that a file was modified (that is, a file

	// A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten
	// or preserved when copying files. If set to NEVER a destination file will not be
	// replaced by a source file, even if the destination file differs from the source
	// file. If you modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you can use
	// this value to protect against overwriting those changes. Some storage classes
	// have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost. For detailed
	// information, see using-storage-classes in the AWS DataSync User Guide.
	OverwriteMode OverwriteMode

	// A value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific
	// purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file. Default value:
	// PRESERVE. PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended). NONE: Ignore
	// permissions. AWS DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.
	PosixPermissions PosixPermissions

	// A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the
	// source file system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage
	// cost. If your task deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration
	// charges for certain storage classes. For detailed information, see
	// using-storage-classes in the AWS DataSync User Guide. Default value: PRESERVE.
	// PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended). REMOVE: Delete
	// destination files that aren’t present in the source.
	PreserveDeletedFiles PreserveDeletedFiles

	// A value that determines whether AWS DataSync should preserve the metadata of
	// block and character devices in the source file system, and recreate the files
	// with that device name and metadata on the destination. AWS DataSync can't sync
	// the actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal and don't
	// return an end-of-file (EOF) marker. Default value: NONE. NONE: Ignore special
	// devices (recommended). PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata.
	// This option isn't currently supported for Amazon EFS.
	PreserveDevices PreserveDevices

	// A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the
	// tasks. If set to ENABLED, the tasks will be queued. The default is ENABLED. If
	// you use the same agent to run multiple tasks, you can enable the tasks to run in
	// series. For more information, see queue-task-execution.
	TaskQueueing TaskQueueing

	// A value that determines whether DataSync transfers only the data and metadata
	// that differ between the source and the destination location, or whether DataSync
	// transfers all the content from the source, without comparing to the destination
	// location. CHANGED: DataSync copies only data or metadata that is new or
	// different content from the source location to the destination location. ALL:
	// DataSync copies all source location content to the destination, without
	// comparing to existing content on the destination.
	TransferMode TransferMode

	// The user ID (UID) of the file's owner. Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves
	// the integer value of the ID. INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and
	// group ID (GID) (recommended). NONE: Ignore UID and GID.
	Uid Uid

	// A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be
	// performed at the end of a task execution after all data and metadata have been
	// transferred. For more information, see create-task Default value:
	// POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT. ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended): Perform
	// verification only on files that were transferred. POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Scan
	// the entire source and entire destination at the end of the transfer to verify
	// that source and destination are fully synchronized. This option isn't supported
	// when transferring to S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes.
	// NONE: No additional verification is done at the end of the transfer, but all
	// data transmissions are integrity-checked with checksum verification during the
	// transfer.
