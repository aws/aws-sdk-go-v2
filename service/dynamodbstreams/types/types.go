// multi-valued attribute is a set; duplicate values are not allowed.

// Represents a single element of a key schema. A key schema specifies the

// For example, a simple primary key (partition key) would be represented by one
// KeySchemaElement. A composite primary key (partition key and sort key) would
// require one KeySchemaElement for the partition key, and another KeySchemaElement
// for the sort key. The partition key of an item is also known as its hash
// attribute. The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's usage of an
// internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based
// on their partition key values. The sort key of an item is also known as its
// range attribute. The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores
// items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by
// the sort key value.
