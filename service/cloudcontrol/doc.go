// Package cloudcontrol provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS Cloud Control API.
//
// Use Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API to create, read, update, delete, and
// list (CRUD-L) your cloud resources that belong to a wide range of services--both
// Amazon Web Services and third-party. With the Cloud Control API standardized set
// of application programming interfaces (APIs), you can perform CRUD-L operations
// on any supported resources in your Amazon Web Services account. Using Cloud
// Control API, you won't have to generate code or scripts specific to each
// individual service responsible for those resources. For more information about
// Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API, see the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control
// API User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/what-is-cloudcontrolapi.html).
