// Writes multiple data records into a delivery stream in a single call, which can
// achieve higher throughput per producer than when writing single records. To
// write single data records into a delivery stream, use PutRecord. Applications
// using these operations are referred to as producers. For information about
// service quota, see Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Quota
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/limits.html). Each
// PutRecordBatch request supports up to 500 records. Each record in the request
// can be as large as 1,000 KB (before 64-bit encoding), up to a limit of 4 MB for
// the entire request. These limits cannot be changed. You must specify the name of
// the delivery stream and the data record when using PutRecord. The data record
// consists of a data blob that can be up to 1,000 KB in size, and any kind of
// data. For example, it could be a segment from a log file, geographic location
// data, website clickstream data, and so on. Kinesis Data Firehose buffers records
// before delivering them to the destination. To disambiguate the data blobs at the
// destination, a common solution is to use delimiters in the data, such as a
// newline (\n) or some other character unique within the data. This allows the
// consumer application to parse individual data items when reading the data from
// the destination. The PutRecordBatch response includes a count of failed records,
// FailedPutCount, and an array of responses, RequestResponses. Even if the
// PutRecordBatch call succeeds, the value of FailedPutCount may be greater than 0,
// indicating that there are records for which the operation didn't succeed. Each
// entry in the RequestResponses array provides additional information about the
// processed record. It directly correlates with a record in the request array
// using the same ordering, from the top to the bottom. The response array always
// includes the same number of records as the request array. RequestResponses
// includes both successfully and unsuccessfully processed records. Kinesis Data
// Firehose tries to process all records in each PutRecordBatch request. A single
// record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent records. A
// successfully processed record includes a RecordId value, which is unique for the
// record. An unsuccessfully processed record includes ErrorCode and ErrorMessage
// values. ErrorCode reflects the type of error, and is one of the following
// values: ServiceUnavailableException or InternalFailure. ErrorMessage provides
// more detailed information about the error. If there is an internal server error
// or a timeout, the write might have completed or it might have failed. If
// FailedPutCount is greater than 0, retry the request, resending only those
// records that might have failed processing. This minimizes the possible duplicate
// records and also reduces the total bytes sent (and corresponding charges). We
// recommend that you handle any duplicates at the destination. If PutRecordBatch
// throws ServiceUnavailableException, back off and retry. If the exception
// persists, it is possible that the throughput limits have been exceeded for the
// delivery stream. Data records sent to Kinesis Data Firehose are stored for 24
// hours from the time they are added to a delivery stream as it attempts to send
// the records to the destination. If the destination is unreachable for more than
// 24 hours, the data is no longer available. Don't concatenate two or more base64
// strings to form the data fields of your records. Instead, concatenate the raw
// data, then perform base64 encoding.
