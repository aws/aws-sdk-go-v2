// Use Expression to filter by cost or by usage. There are two patterns:
//
//     *
// Simple dimension values - You can set the dimension name and values for the
// filters that you plan to use. For example, you can filter for REGION==us-east-1
// OR REGION==us-west-1. The Expression for that looks like this: { "Dimensions": {
// "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", “us-west-1” ] } } The list of
// dimension values are OR'd together to retrieve cost or usage data. You can
// create Expression and DimensionValues objects using either with* methods or set*
// methods in multiple lines.
//
//     * Compound dimension values with logical
// operations - You can use multiple Expression types and the logical operators
// AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one or more Expression objects. This allows you
// to filter on more advanced options. For example, you can filter on ((REGION ==
// us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE !=
// DataTransfer). The Expression for that looks like this: { "And": [ {"Or": [
// {"Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }},
// {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimensions":
// { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }  Because each
// Expression can have only one operator, the service returns an error if more than
// one is specified. The following example shows an Expression object that creates
// an error.  { "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimension": "USAGE_TYPE",
// "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }
//
// For GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a
