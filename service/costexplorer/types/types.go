	// Use Expression to filter by cost or by usage. There are two patterns:
	//
	// * Simple
	// dimension values - You can set the dimension name and values for the filters
	// that you plan to use. For example, you can filter for REGION==us-east-1 OR
	// REGION==us-west-1. For GetRightsizingRecommendation, the Region is a full name
	// (for example, REGION==US East (N. Virginia). The Expression example looks like:
	// { "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", “us-west-1” ] } }
	// The list of dimension values are OR'd together to retrieve cost or usage data.
	// You can create Expression and DimensionValues objects using either with* methods
	// or set* methods in multiple lines.
	//
	// * Compound dimension values with logical
	// operations - You can use multiple Expression types and the logical operators
	// AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one or more Expression objects. This allows you
	// to filter on more advanced options. For example, you can filter on ((REGION ==
	// us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE !=
	// DataTransfer). The Expression for that looks like this: { "And": [ {"Or": [
	// {"Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }},
	// {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimensions":
	// { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }  Because each
