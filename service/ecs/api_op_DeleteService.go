// DeleteServiceRequest returns a request value for making API operation for
// Amazon EC2 Container Service.
//
// Deletes a specified service within a cluster. You can delete a service if
// you have no running tasks in it and the desired task count is zero. If the
// service is actively maintaining tasks, you cannot delete it, and you must
// update the service to a desired task count of zero. For more information,
// see UpdateService.
//
// When you delete a service, if there are still running tasks that require
// cleanup, the service status moves from ACTIVE to DRAINING, and the service
// is no longer visible in the console or in the ListServices API operation.
// After all tasks have transitioned to either STOPPING or STOPPED status, the
// service status moves from DRAINING to INACTIVE. Services in the DRAINING
// or INACTIVE status can still be viewed with the DescribeServices API operation.
// However, in the future, INACTIVE services may be cleaned up and purged from
// Amazon ECS record keeping, and DescribeServices calls on those services return
// a ServiceNotFoundException error.
//
// If you attempt to create a new service with the same name as an existing
// service in either ACTIVE or DRAINING status, you receive an error.
//
//    // Example sending a request using DeleteServiceRequest.
//    req := client.DeleteServiceRequest(params)
//    resp, err := req.Send(context.TODO())
//    if err == nil {
//        fmt.Println(resp)
