	// listed for that instance type on the Amazon EC2 Instances (http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)
	// detail page by 1,024. Linux containers share unallocated CPU units with other
	// containers on the container instance with the same ratio as their allocated
	// amount. For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core
	// instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that's the
	// only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full
	// 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of
	// the same task on that container instance, each task is guaranteed a minimum of
	// 512 CPU units when needed. Moreover, each container could float to higher CPU
	// usage if the other container was not using it. If both tasks were 100% active
	// all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units. On Linux container
	// instances, the Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to
	// calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers. For more
	// information, see CPU share constraint (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#cpu-share-constraint)
	// in the Docker documentation. The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux
	// kernel allows is 2. However, the CPU parameter isn't required, and you can use
	// CPU values below 2 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2
	// (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent
	// version:
	//   - Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0: Null and zero CPU values are
	//   passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU
	//   values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux kernel converts to two
	//   CPU shares.
	//   - Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0: Null, zero, and CPU values
	//   of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.
	// On Windows container instances, the CPU limit is enforced as an absolute limit,
	// or a quota. Windows containers only have access to the specified amount of CPU
	// that's described in the task definition. A null or zero CPU value is passed to
	// Docker as 0 , which Windows interprets as 1% of one CPU.

	Memory *int32

	// The soft limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for the container. When system
	// memory is under heavy contention, Docker attempts to keep the container memory

	// needs to, up to either the hard limit specified with the memory parameter (if
	// applicable), or all of the available memory on the container instance, whichever

	// section of the Docker Remote API (https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/)
	// and the --memory-reservation option to docker run (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration)
	// . If a task-level memory value is not specified, you must specify a non-zero
	// integer for one or both of memory or memoryReservation in a container
	// definition. If you specify both, memory must be greater than memoryReservation .
	// If you specify memoryReservation , then that value is subtracted from the
	// available memory resources for the container instance where the container is
	// placed. Otherwise, the value of memory is used. For example, if your container
	// normally uses 128 MiB of memory, but occasionally bursts to 256 MiB of memory
	// for short periods of time, you can set a memoryReservation of 128 MiB, and a
	// memory hard limit of 300 MiB. This configuration would allow the container to
	// only reserve 128 MiB of memory from the remaining resources on the container
	// instance, but also allow the container to consume more memory resources when

// An object representing a container health check. Health check parameters that

// container agent only monitors and reports on the health checks specified in the
// task definition. Amazon ECS does not monitor Docker health checks that are
// embedded in a container image and not specified in the container definition.
// Health check parameters that are specified in a container definition override
// any Docker health checks that exist in the container image. You can view the
// health status of both individual containers and a task with the DescribeTasks
// API operation or when viewing the task details in the console. The health check
// is designed to make sure that your containers survive agent restarts, upgrades,
// or temporary unavailability. The following describes the possible healthStatus
// values for a container:
//   - HEALTHY -The container health check has passed successfully.
//   - UNHEALTHY -The container health check has failed.
//   - UNKNOWN -The container health check is being evaluated, there's no container
//     health check defined, or Amazon ECS doesn't have the health status of the
//     container.
//
// The following describes the possible healthStatus values based on the container
// health checker status of essential containers in the task with the following
// priority order (high to low):
//   - UNHEALTHY -One or more essential containers have failed their health check.
//   - UNKNOWN -Any essential container running within the task is in an UNKNOWN
//     state and no other essential containers have an UNHEALTHY state.
//   - HEALTHY -All essential containers within the task have passed their health
//     checks.
//
// Consider the following task health example with 2 containers.
//   - If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN , the task health is
//     UNHEALTHY .
//   - If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is HEALTHY , the task health is
//     UNHEALTHY .
//   - If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN , the task health is
//     UNKNOWN .
//   - If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is HEALTHY , the task health is
//     HEALTHY .
//
// Consider the following task health example with 3 containers.
//   - If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN , and Container3 is
//     UNKNOWN , the task health is UNHEALTHY .
//   - If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN , and Container3 is
//     HEALTHY , the task health is UNHEALTHY .
//   - If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is HEALTHY , and Container3 is
//     HEALTHY , the task health is UNHEALTHY .
//   - If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN , and Container3 is
//     HEALTHY , the task health is UNKNOWN .
//   - If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN , and Container3 is
//     UNKNOWN , the task health is UNKNOWN .
//   - If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is HEALTHY , and Container3 is
//     HEALTHY , the task health is HEALTHY .
//
// If a task is run manually, and not as part of a service, the task will continue
// its lifecycle regardless of its health status. For tasks that are part of a
// service, if the task reports as unhealthy then the task will be stopped and the
// service scheduler will replace it. The following are notes about container
// health check support:
//   - When the Amazon ECS agent cannot connect to the Amazon ECS service, the
//     service reports the container as UNHEALTHY .
//   - The health check statuses are the "last heard from" response from the
//     Amazon ECS agent. There are no assumptions made about the status of the
//     container health checks.
//   - Container health checks require version 1.17.0 or greater of the Amazon ECS
//     container agent. For more information, see Updating the Amazon ECS container
//     agent (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html)

//   - Container health checks are supported for Fargate tasks if you're using
