// Package ecs provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for Amazon
// EC2 Container Service.
//
// Amazon Elastic Container Service Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)
// is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to
// run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster
// on a serverless infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your
// services or tasks using the Fargate launch type. For more control, you can host
// your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances
// that you manage by using the EC2 launch type. For more information about launch
// types, see Amazon ECS Launch Types
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html).
// Amazon ECS lets you launch and stop container-based applications with simple API
// calls, allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service,
// and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features. You can use Amazon
// ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your
// resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon ECS
// eliminates the need for you to operate your own cluster management and
// configuration management systems or worry about scaling your management
// infrastructure.
