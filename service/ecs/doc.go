// Package ecs provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for Amazon
// EC2 Container Service.
//
// Amazon Elastic Container Service Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)
// is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to
// run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster
// on a serverless infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your
// services or tasks on AWS Fargate. For more control, you can host your tasks on a
// cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage.
// Amazon ECS makes it easy to launch and stop container-based applications with
// simple API calls, allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized
// service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features. You can use
// Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on
// your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon
// ECS eliminates the need for you to operate your own cluster management and
// configuration management systems or worry about scaling your management
// infrastructure.
