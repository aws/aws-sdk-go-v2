// Package elasticloadbalancingv2 provides the API client, operations, and
// parameter types for Elastic Load Balancing.
//
// Elastic Load Balancing A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across
// targets, such as your EC2 instances. This enables you to increase the
// availability of your application. The load balancer also monitors the health of
// its registered targets and ensures that it routes traffic only to healthy
// targets. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by
// specifying one or more listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port
// number for connections from clients to the load balancer. You configure a target
// group with a protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer to
// the targets, and with health check settings to be used when checking the health
// status of the targets. Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of
// load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic
// Load Balancers. This reference covers Application Load Balancers and Network
// Load Balancers. An Application Load Balancer makes routing and load balancing
// decisions at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS). A Network Load Balancer makes
// routing and load balancing decisions at the transport layer (TCP/TLS). Both
// Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers can route requests to one
// or more ports on each EC2 instance or container instance in your virtual private
// cloud (VPC). For more information, see the Elastic Load Balancing User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/). All
// Elastic Load Balancing operations are idempotent, which means that they complete
// at most one time. If you repeat an operation, it succeeds.
