// Package lambda provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Lambda.
//
// Lambda Overview Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without
// provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability
// compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute
// resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity
// provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. With Lambda,
// you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service. For
// more information about the Lambda service, see What is Lambda
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) in the Lambda
// Developer Guide. The Lambda API Reference provides information about each of the
// API methods, including details about the parameters in each API request and
// response. You can use Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development
// Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools to access the API. For
// installation instructions, see Tools for Amazon Web Services
// (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/). For a list of Region-specific endpoints that
// Lambda supports, see Lambda endpoints and quotas
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lambda-service.html/) in the
// Amazon Web Services General Reference.
