// ShutdownGatewayRequest returns a request value for making API operation for
// AWS Storage Gateway.
//
// Shuts down a gateway. To specify which gateway to shut down, use the Amazon
// Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in the body of your request.
//
// The operation shuts down the gateway service component running in the gateway's
// virtual machine (VM) and not the host VM.
//
// If you want to shut down the VM, it is recommended that you first shut down
// the gateway component in the VM to avoid unpredictable conditions.
//
// After the gateway is shutdown, you cannot call any other API except StartGateway,
// DescribeGatewayInformation, and ListGateways. For more information, see ActivateGateway.
// Your applications cannot read from or write to the gateway's storage volumes,
// and there are no snapshots taken.
//
// When you make a shutdown request, you will get a 200 OK success response
// immediately. However, it might take some time for the gateway to shut down.
// You can call the DescribeGatewayInformation API to check the status. For
// more information, see ActivateGateway.
//
// If do not intend to use the gateway again, you must delete the gateway (using
// DeleteGateway) to no longer pay software charges associated with the gateway.
//
//    // Example sending a request using ShutdownGatewayRequest.
//    req := client.ShutdownGatewayRequest(params)
//    resp, err := req.Send(context.TODO())
//    if err == nil {
//        fmt.Println(resp)
