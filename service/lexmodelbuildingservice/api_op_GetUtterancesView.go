// Use the GetUtterancesView operation to get information about the utterances that
// your users have made to your bot. You can use this list to tune the utterances
// that your bot responds to. For example, say that you have created a bot to order
// flowers. After your users have used your bot for a while, use the
// GetUtterancesView operation to see the requests that they have made and whether
// they have been successful. You might find that the utterance "I want flowers" is
// not being recognized. You could add this utterance to the OrderFlowers intent so
// that your bot recognizes that utterance. After you publish a new version of a
// bot, you can get information about the old version and the new so that you can
// compare the performance across the two versions. Utterance statistics are
// generated once a day. Data is available for the last 15 days. You can request
// information for up to 5 versions of your bot in each request. Amazon Lex returns
// the most frequent utterances received by the bot in the last 15 days. The
// response contains information about a maximum of 100 utterances for each
// version. If you set childDirected field to true when you created your bot, or if
// you opted out of participating in improving Amazon Lex, utterances are not
// available. This operation requires permissions for the lex:GetUtterancesView
// action.
