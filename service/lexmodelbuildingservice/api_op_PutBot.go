// Creates an Amazon Lex conversational bot or replaces an existing bot. When you
// create or update a bot you are only required to specify a name, a locale, and
// whether the bot is directed toward children under age 13. You can use this to
// add intents later, or to remove intents from an existing bot. When you create a
// bot with the minimum information, the bot is created or updated but Amazon Lex
// returns the  response FAILED. You can build the bot after you add one or more
// intents. For more information about Amazon Lex bots, see how-it-works (). If you
// specify the name of an existing bot, the fields in the request replace the
// existing values in the $LATEST version of the bot. Amazon Lex removes any fields
// that you don't provide values for in the request, except for the
// idleTTLInSeconds and privacySettings fields, which are set to their default
// values. If you don't specify values for required fields, Amazon Lex throws an
// exception.  <p>This operation requires permissions for the
// <code>lex:PutBot</code> action. For more information, see

	// For each Amazon Lex bot created with the Amazon Lex Model Building Service, you

	// other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children
	// under age 13 and subject to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
	// by specifying true or false in the childDirected field. By specifying true in
	// the childDirected field, you confirm that your use of Amazon Lex is related to a
	// website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or
	// in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. By specifying false in
	// the childDirected field, you confirm that your use of Amazon Lex is not related
	// to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in
	// whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. You may not
	// specify a default value for the childDirected field that does not accurately
	// reflect whether your use of Amazon Lex is related to a website, program, or
	// other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children
	// under age 13 and subject to COPPA. If your use of Amazon Lex relates to a
	// website, program, or other application that is directed in whole or in part, to
	// children under age 13, you must obtain any required verifiable parental consent
	// under COPPA. For information regarding the use of Amazon Lex in connection with
	// websites, programs, or other applications that are directed or targeted, in
	// whole or in part, to children under age 13, see the Amazon Lex FAQ.
	// (https://aws.amazon.com/lex/faqs#data-security)
	//
	// This member is required.
	ChildDirected *bool

	// Specifies the target locale for the bot. Any intent used in the bot must be
	// compatible with the locale of the bot.  <p>The default is
	// <code>en-US</code>.</p>
	//
	// This member is required.
	Locale types.Locale

	// The name of the bot. The name is not case sensitive.
	//
	// This member is required.
	Name *string

	// When Amazon Lex can't understand the user's input in context, it tries to elicit
	// the information a few times. After that, Amazon Lex sends the message defined in
	// abortStatement to the user, and then aborts the conversation. To set the number
	// of retries, use the valueElicitationPrompt field for the slot type. For example,
	// in a pizza ordering bot, Amazon Lex might ask a user "What type of crust would
	// you like?" If the user's response is not one of the expected responses (for
	// example, "thin crust, "deep dish," etc.), Amazon Lex tries to elicit a correct
	// response a few more times. For example, in a pizza ordering application,
	// OrderPizza might be one of the intents. This intent might require the CrustType
	// slot. You specify the valueElicitationPrompt field when you create the CrustType
	// slot. If you have defined a fallback intent the abort statement will not be sent
	// to the user, the fallback intent is used instead. For more information, see
	// AMAZON.FallbackIntent
	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/built-in-intent-fallback.html).
	AbortStatement *types.Statement

	// Identifies a specific revision of the $LATEST version. When you create a new
	// bot, leave the checksum field blank. If you specify a checksum you get a
	// BadRequestException exception. When you want to update a bot, set the checksum
	// field to the checksum of the most recent revision of the $LATEST version. If you
	// don't specify the  checksum field, or if the checksum does not match the $LATEST
	// version, you get a PreconditionFailedException exception.
	Checksum *string

	// When Amazon Lex doesn't understand the user's intent, it uses this message to
	// get clarification. To specify how many times Amazon Lex should repeat the
	// clarification prompt, use the maxAttempts field. If Amazon Lex still doesn't
	// understand, it sends the message in the abortStatement field. When you create a
	// clarification prompt, make sure that it suggests the correct response from the
	// user. for example, for a bot that orders pizza and drinks, you might create this
	// clarification prompt: "What would you like to do? You can say 'Order a pizza' or
	// 'Order a drink.'" If you have defined a fallback intent, it will be invoked if
	// the clarification prompt is repeated the number of times defined in the
	// maxAttempts field. For more information, see  AMAZON.FallbackIntent
	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/built-in-intent-fallback.html). If
	// you don't define a clarification prompt, at runtime Amazon Lex will return a 400
	// Bad Request exception in three cases:
	//
	//     * Follow-up prompt - When the user
	// responds to a follow-up prompt but does not provide an intent. For example, in
	// response to a follow-up prompt that says "Would you like anything else today?"
	// the user says "Yes." Amazon Lex will return a 400 Bad Request exception because
	// it does not have a clarification prompt to send to the user to get an intent.
	//
	//
	// * Lambda function - When using a Lambda function, you return an ElicitIntent
	// dialog type. Since Amazon Lex does not have a clarification prompt to get an
	// intent from the user, it returns a 400 Bad Request exception.
	//
	//     * PutSession
	// operation - When using the PutSession operation, you send an ElicitIntent dialog
	// type. Since Amazon Lex does not have a clarification prompt to get an intent
	// from the user, it returns a 400 Bad Request exception.
	ClarificationPrompt *types.Prompt

	// When set to true a new numbered version of the bot is created. This is the same
	// as calling the CreateBotVersion operation. If you don't specify createVersion,
	// the default is false.
	CreateVersion *bool

	// The maximum time in seconds that Amazon Lex retains the data gathered in a
	// conversation. A user interaction session remains active for the amount of time
	// specified. If no conversation occurs during this time, the session expires and
	// Amazon Lex deletes any data provided before the timeout. For example, suppose
	// that a user chooses the OrderPizza intent, but gets sidetracked halfway through
	// placing an order. If the user doesn't complete the order within the specified
	// time, Amazon Lex discards the slot information that it gathered, and the user
	// must start over. If you don't include the idleSessionTTLInSeconds element in a
	// PutBot operation request, Amazon Lex uses the default value. This is also true
	// if the request replaces an existing bot. The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
