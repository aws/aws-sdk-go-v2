// Package oam provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// CloudWatch Observability Access Manager.
//
// Use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager to create and manage links
// between source accounts and monitoring accounts by using CloudWatch
// cross-account observability. With CloudWatch cross-account observability, you
// can monitor and troubleshoot applications that span multiple accounts within a
// Region. Seamlessly search, visualize, and analyze your metrics, logs, and traces
// in any of the linked accounts without account boundaries. Set up one or more
// Amazon Web Services accounts as monitoring accounts and link them with multiple
// source accounts. A monitoring account is a central Amazon Web Services account
// that can view and interact with observability data generated from source
// accounts. A source account is an individual Amazon Web Services account that
// generates observability data for the resources that reside in it. Source
// accounts share their observability data with the monitoring account. The shared
// observability data can include metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, logs in Amazon
// CloudWatch Logs, and traces in X-Ray.
