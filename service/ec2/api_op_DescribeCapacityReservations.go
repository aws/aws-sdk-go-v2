	DryRun *bool

	// The token to use to retrieve the next page of results.
	NextToken *string

	// The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page. The
	// remaining results can be seen by sending another request with the returned
	// nextToken value. This value can be between 5 and 500. If maxResults is given a
	// larger value than 500, you receive an error.

	// One or more filters.
	//
	//     * instance-type - The type of instance for which the
	// Capacity Reservation reserves capacity.
	//
	//     * owner-id - The ID of the AWS
	// account that owns the Capacity Reservation.
	//
	//     * availability-zone-id - The
	// Availability Zone ID of the Capacity Reservation.
	//
	//     * instance-platform - The
	// type of operating system for which the Capacity Reservation reserves capacity.
	//
	//
	// * availability-zone - The Availability Zone ID of the Capacity Reservation.
	//
	//
	// * tenancy - Indicates the tenancy of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity
	// Reservation can have one of the following tenancy settings:
	//
	//         * default -
	// The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware that is shared with other AWS
	// accounts.
	//
	//         * dedicated - The Capacity Reservation is created on
	// single-tenant hardware that is dedicated to a single AWS account.
	//
	//     * state -
	// The current state of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity Reservation can be in
	// one of the following states:
	//
	//         * active- The Capacity Reservation is
	// active and the capacity is available for your use.
	//
	//         * expired - The
	// Capacity Reservation expired automatically at the date and time specified in
	// your request. The reserved capacity is no longer available for your use.
	//
	//
	// * cancelled - The Capacity Reservation was manually cancelled. The reserved
	// capacity is no longer available for your use.
	//
	//         * pending - The Capacity
	// Reservation request was successful but the capacity provisioning is still
	// pending.
	//
	//         * failed - The Capacity Reservation request has failed. A
	// request might fail due to invalid request parameters, capacity constraints, or
	// instance limit constraints. Failed requests are retained for 60 minutes.
	//
	//     *
	// end-date - The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires. When a
	// Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released and you can no
	// longer launch instances into it. The Capacity Reservation's state changes to
	// expired when it reaches its end date and time.
	//
	//     * end-date-type - Indicates
	// the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Capacity Reservation can have
	// one of the following end types:
	//
	//         * unlimited - The Capacity Reservation
	// remains active until you explicitly cancel it.
	//
	//         * limited - The Capacity
	// Reservation expires automatically at a specified date and time.
	//
	//     *
	// instance-match-criteria - Indicates the type of instance launches that the
	// Capacity Reservation accepts. The options include:
	//
	//         * open - The
	// Capacity Reservation accepts all instances that have matching attributes
	// (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone). Instances that have matching
	// attributes launch into the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying
	// any additional parameters.
	//
	//         * targeted - The Capacity Reservation only
	// accepts instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and
	// Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This ensures
	// that only permitted instances can use the reserved capacity.
