// Package organizations provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS Organizations.
//
// AWS Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your multiple
// AWS accounts into an organization and centrally manage your accounts and their
// resources. This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations operations. For
// more information about using this service, see the AWS Organizations User Guide
// (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html).
// Support and feedback for AWS Organizations We welcome your feedback. Send your
// comments to feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com
// (mailto:feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com) or post your feedback and
// questions in the AWS Organizations support forum
// (http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=219). For more information
// about the AWS support forums, see Forums Help
// (http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa). Endpoint to call When using the AWS
// CLI or the AWS SDK For the current release of Organizations, specify the
// us-east-1 region for all AWS API and AWS CLI calls made from the commercial AWS
// Regions outside of China. If calling from one of the AWS Regions in China, then
// specify cn-northwest-1. You can do this in the AWS CLI by using these parameters
// and commands:
//
// * Use the following parameter with each command to specify both
// the endpoint and its region: --endpoint-url
// https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (from commercial AWS Regions
// outside of China) or --endpoint-url
// https://organizations.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn (from AWS Regions in
// China)
//
// * Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this
// command: aws configure set default.region us-east-1 (from commercial AWS Regions
// outside of China) or aws configure set default.region cn-northwest-1 (from AWS
// Regions in China)
//
// * Use the following parameter with each command to specify
// the endpoint: --region us-east-1 (from commercial AWS Regions outside of China)
// or --region cn-northwest-1 (from AWS Regions in China)
//
// Recording API Requests
// AWS Organizations supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS API calls
// for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using
// information collected by AWS CloudTrail, you can determine which requests the
// Organizations service received, who made the request and when, and so on. For
// more about AWS Organizations and its support for AWS CloudTrail, see Logging AWS
// Organizations Events with AWS CloudTrail
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_incident-response.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration)
// in the AWS Organizations User Guide. To learn more about AWS CloudTrail,
// including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the AWS CloudTrail User
// Guide
// (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html).
