// Package accessanalyzer provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for Access Analyzer.
//
// Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer helps identify potential
// resource-access risks by enabling you to identify any policies that grant access
// to an external principal. It does this by using logic-based reasoning to analyze
// resource-based policies in your Amazon Web Services environment. An external
// principal can be another Amazon Web Services account, a root user, an IAM user
// or role, a federated user, an Amazon Web Services service, or an anonymous user.
// You can also use IAM Access Analyzer to preview and validate public and
// cross-account access to your resources before deploying permissions changes.
// This guide describes the Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer
// operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about IAM
// Access Analyzer, see Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html)
// in the IAM User Guide. To start using IAM Access Analyzer, you first need to
// create an analyzer.
