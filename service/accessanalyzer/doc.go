// Package accessanalyzer provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for Access Analyzer.
//
// AWS IAM Access Analyzer helps identify potential resource-access risks by
// enabling you to identify any policies that grant access to an external
// principal. It does this by using logic-based reasoning to analyze resource-based
// policies in your AWS environment. An external principal can be another AWS
// account, a root user, an IAM user or role, a federated user, an AWS service, or
// an anonymous user. You can also use Access Analyzer to preview and validate
// public and cross-account access to your resources before deploying permissions
// changes. This guide describes the AWS IAM Access Analyzer operations that you
// can call programmatically. For general information about Access Analyzer, see
// AWS IAM Access Analyzer
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html)
// in the IAM User Guide. To start using Access Analyzer, you first need to create
// an analyzer.
