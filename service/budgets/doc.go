// Package budgets provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Budgets.
//
// The AWS Budgets API enables you to use AWS Budgets to plan your service usage,
// service costs, and instance reservations. The API reference provides
// descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types
// for AWS Budgets. Budgets provide you with a way to see the following
// information:
//
// * How close your plan is to your budgeted amount or to the free
// tier limits
//
// * Your usage-to-date, including how much you've used of your
// Reserved Instances (RIs)
//
// * Your current estimated charges from AWS, and how
// much your predicted usage will accrue in charges by the end of the month
//
// * How
// much of your budget has been used
//
// AWS updates your budget status several times
// a day. Budgets track your unblended costs, subscriptions, refunds, and RIs. You
// can create the following types of budgets:
//
// * Cost budgets - Plan how much you
// want to spend on a service.
//
// * Usage budgets - Plan how much you want to use one
// or more services.
//
// * RI utilization budgets - Define a utilization threshold,
// and receive alerts when your RI usage falls below that threshold. This lets you
// see if your RIs are unused or under-utilized.
//
// * RI coverage budgets - Define a
// coverage threshold, and receive alerts when the number of your instance hours
// that are covered by RIs fall below that threshold. This lets you see how much of
// your instance usage is covered by a reservation.
//
// Service Endpoint The AWS
// Budgets API provides the following endpoint:
//
// *
// https://budgets.amazonaws.com
//
// For information about costs that are associated
// with the AWS Budgets API, see AWS Cost Management Pricing
// (https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/pricing/).
