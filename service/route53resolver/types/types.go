	// * OPERATIONAL: The Amazon
	// VPC network interfaces for this endpoint are correctly configured and able to
	// pass inbound or outbound DNS queries between your network and Resolver.
	//
	// *
	// UPDATING: Resolver is associating or disassociating one or more network
	// interfaces with this endpoint.
	//
	// * AUTO_RECOVERING: Resolver is trying to recover
	// one or more of the network interfaces that are associated with this endpoint.
	// During the recovery process, the endpoint functions with limited capacity
	// because of the limit on the number of DNS queries per IP address (per network
	// interface). For the current limit, see Limits on Route 53 Resolver
	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DNSLimitations.html#limits-api-entities-resolver).
	//
	// *
	// ACTION_NEEDED: This endpoint is unhealthy, and Resolver can't automatically
	// recover it. To resolve the problem, we recommend that you check each IP address
	// that you associated with the endpoint. For each IP address that isn't available,
	// add another IP address and then delete the IP address that isn't available. (An
	// endpoint must always include at least two IP addresses.) A status of
	// ACTION_NEEDED can have a variety of causes. Here are two common causes:
	//
	// * One
	// or more of the network interfaces that are associated with the endpoint were
	// deleted using Amazon VPC.
	//
	// * The network interface couldn't be created for some
	// reason that's outside the control of Resolver.
	//
	// * DELETING: Resolver is deleting
	// this endpoint and the associated network interfaces.
