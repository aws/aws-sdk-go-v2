// Package computeoptimizerautomation provides the API client, operations, and
// parameter types for Compute Optimizer Automation.
//
//	Automation is a feature within Amazon Web Services Compute Optimizer that
//
// enables you to apply optimization recommendations to your Amazon Web Services
// resources, reducing costs and improving performance. You can apply recommended
// actions directly or create automation rules that implement recommendations on a
// recurring schedule when they match your specified criteria. With automation
// rules, set criteria such as Amazon Web Services Region and Resource Tags to
// target specific geographies and workloads. Configure rules to run daily, weekly,
// or monthly, and Compute Optimizer continuously evaluates new recommendations
// against your criteria. Track automation events over time, examine detailed step
// history, estimate savings achieved, and reverse actions directly from Compute
// Optimizer when needed.
