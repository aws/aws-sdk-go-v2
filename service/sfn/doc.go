// Package sfn provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Step Functions.
//
// AWS Step Functions AWS Step Functions is a service that lets you coordinate the
// components of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows.
// You can use Step Functions to build applications from individual components,
// each of which performs a discrete function, or task, allowing you to scale and
// change applications quickly. Step Functions provides a console that helps
// visualize the components of your application as a series of steps. Step
// Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries steps when
// there are errors, so your application executes predictably and in the right
// order every time. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so you can quickly
// diagnose and debug any issues. Step Functions manages operations and underlying
// infrastructure to ensure your application is available at any scale. You can run
// tasks on AWS, your own servers, or any system that has access to AWS. You can
// access and use Step Functions using the console, the AWS SDKs, or an HTTP API.
// For more information about Step Functions, see the AWS Step Functions Developer
// Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html) .
