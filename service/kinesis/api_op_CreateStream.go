// Creates a Kinesis data stream. A stream captures and transports data records
// that are continuously emitted from different data sources or producers.
// Scale-out within a stream is explicitly supported by means of shards, which are
// uniquely identified groups of data records in a stream. You specify and control
// the number of shards that a stream is composed of. Each shard can support reads
// up to five transactions per second, up to a maximum data read total of 2 MB per
// second. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a
// maximum data write total of 1 MB per second. If the amount of data input
// increases or decreases, you can add or remove shards. The stream name identifies
// the stream. The name is scoped to the AWS account used by the application. It is
// also scoped by AWS Region. That is, two streams in two different accounts can
// have the same name, and two streams in the same account, but in two different
// Regions, can have the same name. CreateStream is an asynchronous operation. Upon
// receiving a CreateStream request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns and
// sets the stream status to CREATING. After the stream is created, Kinesis Data
// Streams sets the stream status to ACTIVE. You should perform read and write
// operations only on an ACTIVE stream. You receive a LimitExceededException when
// making a CreateStream request when you try to do one of the following:
//
//     *
// Have more than five streams in the CREATING state at any point in time.
//
//     *
// Create more shards than are authorized for your account.
//
// For the default shard
// limit for an AWS account, see Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Limits
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html)
// in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide. To increase this limit,
// contact AWS Support
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html). You can
// use DescribeStream to check the stream status, which is returned in
// StreamStatus. CreateStream () has a limit of five transactions per second per
// account.
