	// the resources in your account that you have selected for Config to record. If
	// you are running ephemeral workloads, you may see increased activity from Config
	// as it records configuration changes associated with creating and deleting these
	// temporary resources. An ephemeral workload is a temporary use of computing
	// resources that are loaded and run when needed. Examples include Amazon Elastic
	// Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Spot Instances, Amazon EMR jobs, and Auto Scaling. If
	// you want to avoid the increased activity from running ephemeral workloads, you
	// can run these types of workloads in a separate account with Config turned off to
