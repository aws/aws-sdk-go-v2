// Package configservice provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS Config.
//
// AWS Config AWS Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations of all
// the AWS resources associated with your AWS account. You can use AWS Config to
// get the current and historical configurations of each AWS resource and also to
// get information about the relationship between the resources. An AWS resource
// can be an Amazon Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Elastic Block Store
// (EBS) volume, an elastic network Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a
// complete list of resources currently supported by AWS Config, see Supported AWS
// Resources
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources).
// You can access and manage AWS Config through the AWS Management Console, the AWS
// Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the AWS Config API, or the AWS SDKs for AWS
// Config. This reference guide contains documentation for the AWS Config API and
// the AWS CLI commands that you can use to manage AWS Config. The AWS Config API
// uses the Signature Version 4 protocol for signing requests. For more information
// about how to sign a request with this protocol, see Signature Version 4 Signing
// Process
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html). For
// detailed information about AWS Config features and their associated actions or
// commands, as well as how to work with AWS Management Console, see What Is AWS
// Config
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html) in
// the AWS Config Developer Guide.
