// Package entityresolution provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for AWS EntityResolution.
//
// Welcome to the AWS Entity Resolution API Reference. AWS Entity Resolution is an
// AWS service that provides pre-configured entity resolution capabilities that
// enable developers and analysts at advertising and marketing companies to build
// an accurate and complete view of their consumers. With AWS Entity Resolution,
// you have the ability to match source records containing consumer identifiers,
// such as name, email address, and phone number. This holds true even when these
// records have incomplete or conflicting identifiers. For example, AWS Entity
// Resolution can effectively match a source record from a customer relationship
// management (CRM) system, which includes account information like first name,
// last name, postal address, phone number, and email address, with a source record
// from a marketing system containing campaign information, such as username and
// email address. To learn more about AWS Entity Resolution concepts, procedures,
// and best practices, see the AWS Entity Resolution User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/entityresolution/latest/userguide/what-is-service.html)
