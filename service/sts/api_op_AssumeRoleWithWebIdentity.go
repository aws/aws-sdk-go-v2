// Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been
// authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity provider.
// Example providers include Amazon Cognito, Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google,
// or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. For mobile applications, we
// recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You can use Amazon Cognito with the AWS
// SDK for iOS Developer Guide (http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/) and the AWS SDK
// for Android Developer Guide (http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/) to uniquely
// identify a user. You can also supply the user with a consistent identity
// throughout the lifetime of an application. To learn more about Amazon Cognito,
// see Amazon Cognito Overview
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e840)
// in AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide and Amazon Cognito Overview
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e664)
// in the AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide. Calling AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity does
// not require the use of AWS security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute
// an application (for example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security
// credentials without including long-term AWS credentials in the application. You
// also don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term AWS
// credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a token
// from the web identity provider. For a comparison of AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
// with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see Requesting
// Temporary Security Credentials
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html)
// and Comparing the AWS STS API operations
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison)
// in the IAM User Guide. The temporary security credentials returned by this API
// consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token.
// Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS
// service API operations. Session Duration By default, the temporary security
// credentials created by AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity last for one hour. However, you
// can use the optional DurationSeconds parameter to specify the duration of your
// session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum
// session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour
// to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see View the
// Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session)
// in the IAM User Guide. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use
// the AssumeRole* API operations or the assume-role* CLI commands. However the
// limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For
// more information, see Using IAM Roles
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html) in the IAM
// User Guide. Permissions The temporary security credentials created by
// AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with
// the following exception: you cannot call the STS GetFederationToken or
// GetSessionToken API operations. (Optional) You can pass inline or managed
// session policies
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
// to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an
// inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as
// managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and
// managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this
// operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions
// are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session
// policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API
// calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use
// session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the
// identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information,
// see Session Policies
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
// in the IAM User Guide. Tags (Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass
// attributes into your web identity token as session tags. Each session tag
// consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about
// session tags, see Passing Session Tags in STS
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html) in the
// IAM User Guide. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plain text session tag
// keys can’t exceed 128 characters and the values can’t exceed 256 characters. For
// these and additional limits, see IAM and STS Character Limits
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-limits.html#reference_iam-limits-entity-length)
// in the IAM User Guide.  <note> <p>An AWS conversion compresses the passed
// session policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a
// separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plain text
// meets the other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element
// indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to
// the upper size limit. </p> </note> <p>You can pass a session tag with the same
// key as a tag that is attached to the role. When you do, the session tag
// overrides the role tag with the same key.</p> <p>An administrator must grant you
// the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also
// create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For
// more information, see <a
// href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html">Tutorial:
// Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User
// Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags
// persist during role chaining. For more information, see <a
// href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining">Chaining
// Roles with Session Tags</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>
// <b>Identities</b> </p> <p>Before your application can call
// <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>, you must have an identity token from a
// supported identity provider and create a role that the application can assume.
// The role that your application assumes must trust the identity provider that is
// associated with the identity token. In other words, the identity provider must
// be specified in the role's trust policy. </p> <important> <p>Calling
// <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can result in an entry in your AWS
// CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the <a
// href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims">Subject</a>
// of the provided Web Identity Token. We recommend that you avoid using any
// personally identifiable information (PII) in this field. For example, you could
// instead use a GUID or a pairwise identifier, as <a
// href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes">suggested
// in the OIDC specification</a>.</p> </important> <p>For more information about
// how to use web identity federation and the
// <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> API, see the following resources: </p>
