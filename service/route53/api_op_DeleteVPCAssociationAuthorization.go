// Removes authorization to submit an AssociateVPCWithHostedZone request to
// associate a specified VPC with a hosted zone that was created by a different

// hosted zone, DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorization won't disassociate the VPC from
// the hosted zone. If you want to delete an existing association, use
// DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone.
