// Package rolesanywhere provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for IAM Roles Anywhere.
//
// AWS Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere provides a secure way for your
// workloads such as servers, containers, and applications running outside of AWS
// to obtain Temporary AWS credentials. Your workloads can use the same IAM
// policies and roles that you have configured with native AWS applications to
// access AWS resources. Using IAM Roles Anywhere will eliminate the need to manage
// long term credentials for workloads running outside of AWS. To use IAM Roles
// Anywhere customer workloads will need to use X.509 certificates issued by their
// Certificate Authority (CA) . The Certificate Authority (CA) needs to be
// registered with IAM Roles Anywhere as a trust anchor to establish trust between
// customer PKI and IAM Roles Anywhere. Customers who do not manage their own PKI
// system can use AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority (ACM PCA)
// to create a Certificate Authority and use that to establish trust with IAM Roles
// Anywhere This guide describes the IAM rolesanywhere operations that you can call
// programmatically. For general information about IAM Roles Anywhere see
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/)
