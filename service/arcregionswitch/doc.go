// Package arcregionswitch provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for ARC - Region switch.
//
// Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) Region switch helps you to quickly
// and reliably shift traffic away from an impaired Amazon Web Services Region to a
// healthy Region. With Region switch, you can create plans that define the steps
// to shift traffic for your application from one Amazon Web Services Region to
// another. You can test your plans in practice mode before using them in a real
// recovery scenario.
//
// Region switch provides a structured approach to multi-Region failover, helping
// you to meet your recovery time objectives (RTOs) and maintain business
// continuity during regional disruptions.
//
// For more information, see [Region switch in ARC] in the Amazon Application Recovery Controller User
// Guide.
