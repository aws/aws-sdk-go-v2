// Package wickr provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Wickr Admin API.
//
// Welcome to the Amazon Web Services Wickr API Reference.
//
// The Amazon Web Services Wickr application programming interface (API) is
// designed for administrators to perform key tasks, such as creating and managing
// Amazon Web Services Wickr, networks, users, security groups, bots and more. This
// guide provides detailed information about the Amazon Web Services Wickr API,
// including operations, types, inputs and outputs, and error codes. You can use an
// Amazon Web Services SDK, the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (Amazon
// Web Services CLI, or the REST API to make API calls for Amazon Web Services
// Wickr.
//
// # Using Amazon Web Services SDK
//
// The SDK clients authenticate your requests by using access keys that you
// provide. For more information, see [Authentication and access using Amazon Web Services SDKs and tools]in the Amazon Web Services SDKs and Tools
// Reference Guide.
//
// # Using Amazon Web Services CLI
//
// Use your access keys with the Amazon Web Services CLI to make API calls. For
// more information about setting up the Amazon Web Services CLI, see [Getting started with the Amazon Web Services CLI]in the
// Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface User Guide for Version 2.
//
// # Using REST APIs
//
// If you use REST to make API calls, you must authenticate your request by
// providing a signature. Amazon Web Services Wickr supports Signature Version 4.
// For more information, see [Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4 for API requests]in the Amazon Web Services Identity and Access
// Management User Guide.
//
// Access and permissions to the APIs can be controlled by Amazon Web Services
// Identity and Access Management. The managed policy [Amazon Web ServicesWickrFullAccess]grants full administrative
// permission to the Amazon Web Services Wickr service APIs. For more information
// on restricting access to specific operations, see [Identity and access management for Amazon Web Services Wickr]in the Amazon Web Services
// Wickr Administration Guide.
//
// Types of Errors:
//
// The Amazon Web Services Wickr APIs provide an HTTP interface. HTTP defines
// ranges of HTTP Status Codes for different types of error responses.
//
//   - Client errors are indicated by HTTP Status Code class of 4xx
//
//   - Service errors are indicated by HTTP Status Code class of 5xx
//
// In this reference guide, the documentation for each API has an Errors section
// that includes a brief discussion about HTTP status codes. We recommend looking
// there as part of your investigation when you get an error.
