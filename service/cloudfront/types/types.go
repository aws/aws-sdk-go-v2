	// If the distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the

	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html), provide

	ACMCertificateArn *string

	// If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as

	CloudFrontDefaultCertificate *bool

	// If the distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify the
	// security policy that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with
	// viewers. The security policy determines two settings:
	//
	//     * The minimum SSL/TLS
	// protocol that CloudFront can use to communicate with viewers.
	//
	//     * The ciphers
	// that CloudFront can use to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers.
	//
	// For
	// more information, see Security Policy
	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy)
	// and Supported Protocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and CloudFront
	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers)
	// in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. On the CloudFront console, this
	// setting is called Security Policy. When you’re using SNI only (you set
	// SSLSupportMethod to sni-only), you must specify TLSv1 or higher. If the
	// distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as
	// d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net (you set CloudFrontDefaultCertificate to true),
	// CloudFront automatically sets the security policy to TLSv1 regardless of the
	// value that you set here.
