// A Block represents items that are recognized in a document within a group of
// pixels close to each other. The information returned in a Block object depends
// on the type of operation. In text detection for documents (for example
// DetectDocumentText), you get information about the detected words and lines of
// text. In text analysis (for example AnalyzeDocument), you can also get
// information about the fields, tables, and selection elements that are detected
// in the document. An array of Block objects is returned by both synchronous and
// asynchronous operations. In synchronous operations, such as DetectDocumentText,
// the array of Block objects is the entire set of results. In asynchronous
// operations, such as GetDocumentAnalysis, the array is returned over one or more
// responses. For more information, see How Amazon Textract Works
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/how-it-works.html).
