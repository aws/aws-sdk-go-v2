// A Block represents items that are recognized in a document within a group of
// pixels close to each other. The information returned in a Block object depends
// on the type of operation. In text detection for documents (for example
// DetectDocumentText), you get information about the detected words and lines of
// text. In text analysis (for example AnalyzeDocument), you can also get
// information about the fields, tables, and selection elements that are detected
// in the document. An array of Block objects is returned by both synchronous and
// asynchronous operations. In synchronous operations, such as DetectDocumentText,
// the array of Block objects is the entire set of results. In asynchronous
// operations, such as GetDocumentAnalysis, the array is returned over one or more
// responses. For more information, see How Amazon Textract Works
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/how-it-works.html).
type Block struct {

	// The type of text item that's recognized. In operations for text detection, the
	// following types are returned:
	//
	// * PAGE - Contains a list of the LINE Block
	// objects that are detected on a document page.
	//
	// * WORD - A word detected on a
	// document page. A word is one or more ISO basic Latin script characters that
	// aren't separated by spaces.
	//
	// * LINE - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous
	// words that are detected on a document page.
	//
	// In text analysis operations, the
	// following types are returned:
	//
	// * PAGE - Contains a list of child Block objects
	// that are detected on a document page.
	//
	// * KEY_VALUE_SET - Stores the KEY and
	// VALUE Block objects for linked text that's detected on a document page. Use the
	// EntityType field to determine if a KEY_VALUE_SET object is a KEY Block object or
	// a VALUE Block object.
	//
	// * WORD - A word that's detected on a document page. A
	// word is one or more ISO basic Latin script characters that aren't separated by
	// spaces.
	//
	// * LINE - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that are detected
	// on a document page.

	// * TABLE - A table that's detected on a document page. A
	// table is grid-based information with two or more rows or columns, with a cell
	// span of one row and one column each.
	//
	// * CELL - A cell within a detected table.
	// The cell is the parent of the block that contains the text in the cell.

	// *
	// SELECTION_ELEMENT - A selection element such as an option button (radio button)
	// or a check box that's detected on a document page. Use the value of
	// SelectionStatus to determine the status of the selection element.
