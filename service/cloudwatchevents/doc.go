// Package cloudwatchevents provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for Amazon CloudWatch Events.
//
// Amazon EventBridge helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS resources.
// When your resources change state, they automatically send events into an event
// stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the stream and route
// them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a
// predetermined schedule. For example, you can configure rules to:
//
//     *
// Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event
// notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state.
//
//     * Direct
// specific API records from AWS CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for
// detailed analysis of potential security or availability risks.
//
//     *
// Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS
// volume.
//
// For more information about the features of Amazon EventBridge, see the
// Amazon EventBridge User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide).
