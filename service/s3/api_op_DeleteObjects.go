// DeleteObjectsRequest returns a request value for making API operation for
// Amazon Simple Storage Service.
//
// This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using
// a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete,
// then this operation provides a suitable alternative to sending individual
// delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.
//
// The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In
// the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if
// you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled
// bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete operation and returns the
// result of that delete, success, or failure, in the response. Note that, if
// the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result
// as deleted.
//
// The operation supports two modes for the response; verbose and quiet. By
// default, the operation uses verbose mode in which the response includes the
// result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response
// includes only keys where the delete operation encountered an error. For a
// successful deletion, the operation does not return any information about
// the delete in the response body.
//
// When performing this operation on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts
// to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do
// not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non versioned
// objects you are attempting to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether
// there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete
// request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see MFA Delete (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete).
//
// Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests.
// Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not
// be altered in transit.
