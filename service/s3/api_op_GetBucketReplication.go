// GetBucketReplicationRequest returns a request value for making API operation for
// Amazon Simple Storage Service.
//
// Returns the replication configuration of a bucket.
//
// It can take a while to propagate the put or delete a replication configuration
// to all Amazon S3 systems. Therefore, a get request soon after put or delete
// can return a wrong result.
//
// For information about replication configuration, see Replication (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html).
//
// This operation requires permissions for the s3:GetReplicationConfiguration
// action. For more information about permissions, see Using Bucket Policies
// and User Policies (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html).
//
// If you include the Filter element in a replication configuration, you must
// also include the DeleteMarkerReplication and Priority elements. The response
// also returns those elements.
//
// GetBucketReplication has the following special error:
//
//    * Error code: NoSuchReplicationConfiguration Description: There is no
//    replication configuration with that name. HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found
//    SOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client
//
// The following operations are related to GetBucketReplication:
//
//    * PutBucketReplication

//    * DeleteBucketReplication
