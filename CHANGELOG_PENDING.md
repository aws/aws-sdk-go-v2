### SDK Features

### SDK Enhancements
* `aws/endpoints`: Expose DNSSuffix for partitions ([#368](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/pull/368))
  * Exposes the underlying partition metadata's DNSSuffix value via the `DNSSuffix` method on the endpoint's `Partition` type. This allows access to the partition's DNS suffix, e.g. "amazon.com".
  * Fixes [#347](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/issues/347)
* `private/protocol`: Add support for parsing fractional timestamp ([#367](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/367))
  * Fixes the SDK's ability to parse fractional unix timestamp values and adds tests.
  * Fixes [#365](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/365)

### SDK Bugs
* `aws`: Fixes bug in calculating throttled retry delay ([#373](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/pull/373))
  * The `Retry-After` duration specified in the request is now added to the Retry delay for throttled exception. Adds test for retry delays for throttled exceptions. Fixes bug where the throttled retry's math was off.
  * Fixes [#45](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/issues/45)

* `service/s3/s3manager`: Fix index out of range when a streaming reader returns -1 ([#378](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/378))
  * Fixes the S3 Upload Manager's handling of an unbounded streaming reader that returns negative bytes read.
