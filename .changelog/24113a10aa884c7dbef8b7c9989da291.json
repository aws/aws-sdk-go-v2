    "description": "**BREAKFIX**: Correct nullability of InitialCapacityConfig's WorkerCount field. The type of this value has changed from int64 to *int64. Due to this field being marked required, with an enforced minimum of 1, but a default of 0, the former type would result in automatic failure behavior without caller intervention. Calling code will need to be updated accordingly.",
