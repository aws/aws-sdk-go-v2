These parameters drive how the SDK's API client will initialize its default retryer, if custome retryer has not been specified. See [config](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config) module and [aws.Config](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws#Config) for more information about and how to use these new options.",
