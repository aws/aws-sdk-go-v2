For changes to files under the `/codegen/aws-models` folder, and manual edits to autogenerated code (e.g. `/service/s3/api.go`) please create an Issue instead of a PR for those type of changes.

If the PR addresses an existing bug or feature, please reference it here.

To help speed up the process and reduce the time to merge please ensure that `Allow edits by maintainers` is checked before submitting your PR. This will allow the project maintainers to make minor adjustments or improvements to the submitted PR, allow us to reduce the roundtrip time for merging your request.
