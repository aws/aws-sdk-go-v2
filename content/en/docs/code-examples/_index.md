The {{% alias sdk-go %}} examples can help you write your own Go applications that use Amazon Web Services. The examples
assume you have already set up and configured the SDK (that is, you have imported all required packages and set your
credentials and region). For more information, see [Getting Started]({{< ref "getting-started.md" >}}) and
[Configuring the SDK]({{< ref "configuring-sdk" >}}).

Find the source code for these examples and others in the AWS documentation code examples repository on
[GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/gov2).
To propose a new code example for the AWS documentation team to consider producing, create a new request. The team is
looking to produce code examples that cover broader scenarios and use cases, versus simple code snippets that cover only
individual API calls. For instructions, see the Proposing new code examples section in the
[Readme on GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples).
