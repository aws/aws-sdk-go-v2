# Transfer Managers

The {{% alias service="S3long" %}} upload and download managers can break up large objects, so they can be transferred
in multiple parts, in parallel. This makes it easy to resume interrupted transfers.

## Upload Manager

The {{% alias service="S3long" %}} upload manager determines if a file can be split into
smaller parts and uploaded in parallel. You can customize the number of parallel uploads and the size of the uploaded
parts.

The following example uses the {{% alias service="S3" %}} `Uploader` to upload a file.
Using `Uploader` is similar to the `s3.PutObject()` operation.

```go
import "context"
import "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config"
import "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3"
import "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/feature/s3/manager"

// ...

cfg, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO())
if err != nil {
	log.Printf("error: %v", err)
	return
}

client := s3.NewFromConfig(cfg)

uploader := manager.NewUploader(client)
result, err := uploader.Upload(context.TODO(), &s3.PutObjectInput{
	Bucket: aws.String("my-bucket"),
	Key:    aws.String("my-object-key"),
	Body:   uploadFile,
})
```

### Configuration Options

When you instantiate an `Uploader` instance using [NewUploader]({{% apiref "feature/s3/manager#NewUploader" %}}), you
can specify several configuration options to customize how objects are uploaded. Options are overridden by providing one
or more arguments to `NewUploader`. These options include:

* `PartSize` &ndash; Specifies the buffer size, in bytes, of each part to upload. The minimum size per part is 5 MiB.
* `Concurrency` &ndash; Specifies the number of parts to upload in parallel.
* `LeavePartsOnError` &ndash; Indicates whether to leave successfully uploaded parts in {{% alias service="S3" %}}.
  
The `Concurrency` value limits the concurrent number of part uploads that can occur for a given `Upload` call. 
This is not a global client concurrency limit. Tweak the `PartSize` and `Concurrency` configuration values to find the
optimal configuration. For example, systems with high-bandwidth connections can send bigger parts and more uploads in parallel.

For example, your application configures `Uploader`  with a `Concurrency` of setting of `5`. If your application then 
calls `Upload` from two different goroutines, the result is `10` concurrent part uploads
(2 goroutines * 5 `Concurrency`).

{{% pageinfo color="warning" %}}
Your application is expected to limit the concurrent calls to `Upload` to prevent application resource exhaustion.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Below is an example to set the default part size during `Uploader` creation:
```go
uploader := manager.NewUploader(client, func(u *Uploader) {
	u.PartSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10 MiB
})
```

For more information about `Uploader` and its configurations, see
[Uploader]({{% apiref "feature/s3/manager/#Uploader" %}}) in the {{% alias sdk-api %}}.

### PutObjectInput Body Field (io.ReadSeeker vs. io.Reader)

The `Body` field of the `s3.PutObjectInput` struct is an `io.Reader` type. However, this field can be populated with a
type that satisfies both the `io.ReadSeeker` and `io.ReaderAt` interface to improve application resource utilization
of the host environment. The following example creates the type `ReadSeekerAt` that satisfies both interfaces:

```go
type ReadSeekerAt interface {
	io.ReadSeeker
	io.ReaderAt
}
```

For `io.Reader` types, the bytes of the reader must be buffered in memory before the part can be uploaded. When you
increase the `PartSize` or `Concurrency` value, the required memory (RAM) for the `Uploader` increases significantly.
The required memory is approximately *`PartSize`* \* *`Concurrency`*. For example, specifying 100 MB for `PartSize`
and 10 for `Concurrency`, requires at least 1 GB.

Because an `io.Reader` type cannot determine its size before reading its bytes, `Uploader` cannot calculate how many
parts will be uploaded. Consequently, `Uploader` can reach the {{% alias service="S3" %}} upload limit of 10,000 parts
for large files if you set the `PartSize` too low. If you try to upload more than 10,000 parts, the upload stops and
returns an error.

For `body` values that implement the `ReadSeekerAt` type, the `Uploader` doesn't buffer the body contents in memory
before sending it to {{% alias service="S3" %}}. `Uploader` calculates the expected number of parts before uploading the
file to {{% alias service="S3" %}}. If the current value of `PartSize` requires more than 10,000 parts to upload the
file, `Uploader` increases the part size value so that fewer parts are required.

### Handling Failed Uploads

If an upload to {{% alias service="S3" %}} fails, by default, `Uploader` uses the
{{% alias service="S3" %}} `AbortMultipartUpload` operation to remove the uploaded parts. This functionality ensures
that failed uploads do not consume {{% alias service="S3" %}} storage.

You can set `LeavePartsOnError` to true so that the `Uploader` doesn't delete successfully uploaded parts. This is
useful for resuming  partially completed uploads. To operate on uploaded parts, you must get the `UploadID` of the
failed upload. The following example demonstrates how to use the `manager.MultiUploadFailure` error interface type to
get the `UploadID`.

```go
result, err := uploader.Upload(context.TODO(), &s3.PutObjectInput{
	Bucket: aws.String("my-bucket"),
	Key:    aws.String("my-object-key"),
	Body:   uploadFile,
})
output, err := u.upload(input)
if err != nil {
	var mu manager.MultiUploadFailure
	if errors.As(err, &mu) {
		// Process error and its associated uploadID
		fmt.Println("Error:", mu)
		_ = mu.UploadID() // retrieve the associated UploadID
	} else {
		// Process error generically
		fmt.Println("Error:", err.Error())
	}
	return
}

```

### Overriding Uploader Options Per Upload

You can override the `Uploader` options when calling `Upload` by providing one or more arguments to the
method. These overrides are concurrency-safe modifications and do not affect ongoing uploads, or subsequent `Upload`
calls to the manager. For example, to override the `PartSize` configuration for a specific upload request:

```go
params := &s3.PutObjectInput{
	Bucket: aws.String("my-bucket"),
	Key:    aws.String("my-key"),
	Body:   myBody,
}
resp, err := uploader.Upload(context.TODO(), params, func(u *manager.Uploader) {
	u.PartSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10 MiB
})
```

### Examples

#### Upload a Folder to {{% alias service="S3" %}}

The following example uses the `path/filepath` package to recursively gather a list of files and upload them to the
specified {{% alias service="S3" %}} bucket. The keys of the {{% alias service="S3" %}} objects are prefixed with the
file's relative path.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"

	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/feature/s3/manager"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3"
)

var (
	localPath string
	bucket    string
	prefix    string
)

func init() {
	if len(os.Args) != 4 {
		log.Fatalln("Usage:", os.Args[0], "<local path> <bucket> <prefix>")
	}
	localPath = os.Args[1]
	bucket = os.Args[2]
	prefix = os.Args[3]
}

func main() {
	walker := make(fileWalk)
	go func() {
		// Gather the files to upload by walking the path recursively 
		if err := filepath.Walk(localPath, walker.Walk); err != nil {
			log.Fatalln("Walk failed:", err)
		}
		close(walker)
	}()

	cfg, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO())
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("error:", err)
	}
	
	// For each file found walking, upload it to Amazon S3
	uploader := manager.NewUploader(s3.NewFromConfig(cfg))
	for path := range walker {
		rel, err := filepath.Rel(localPath, path)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalln("Unable to get relative path:", path, err)
		}
		file, err := os.Open(path)
		if err != nil {
			log.Println("Failed opening file", path, err)
			continue
		}
		defer file.Close()
		result, err := uploader.Upload(context.TODO(), &s3.PutObjectInput{
			Bucket: &bucket,
			Key:    aws.String(filepath.Join(prefix, rel)),
			Body:   file,
		})
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalln("Failed to upload", path, err)
		}
		log.Println("Uploaded", path, result.Location)
	}
}

type fileWalk chan string

func (f fileWalk) Walk(path string, info os.FileInfo, err error) error {
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	if !info.IsDir() {
		f <- path
	}
	return nil
}
```

## Download Manager

The {{% alias service="S3" %}} [Downloader]({{% apiref "feature/s3/manager#Downloader" %}}) manager determines if a file
can be split into smaller parts and downloaded in parallel. You can customize the number of parallel downloads and the
size of the downloaded parts.

#### Example: Download a File

The following example uses the {{% alias service="S3" %}} `Downloader` to download a file. Using `Downloader` is similar
to the [s3.GetObject]({{% apiref "service/s3#Client.GetObject" %}}) operation.

```go
import "context"
import "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws"
import "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config"
import "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3"
import "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/feature/s3/manager"

// ...

cfg, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO())
if err != nil {
	log.Println("error:", err)
	return
}

client := s3.NewFromConfig(cfg)

downloader := manager.NewDownloader(client)
numBytes, err := downloader.Download(context.TODO(), downloadFile, &s3.GetObjectInput{
	Bucket: aws.String("my-bucket"), 
	Key:    aws.String("my-key"),
})
```

The `downloadFile` parameter is an `io.WriterAt` type. The `WriterAt` interface enables the `Downloader` to write
multiple parts of the file in parallel.

#### Configuration Options

When you instantiate a `Downloader` instance, you can specify configuration options to customize how objects are
downloaded:

*  `PartSize` &ndash; Specifies the buffer size, in bytes, of each part to
   download. The minimum size per part is 5 MB.
*  `Concurrency` &ndash; Specifies the number of parts to download in
   parallel.

The `Concurrency` value limits the concurrent number of part download that can occur for a given `Download` call.
This is not a global client concurrency limit. Tweak the `PartSize` and `Concurrency` configuration values to find the
optimal configuration. For example, systems with high-bandwidth connections can receive bigger parts and more downloads
in parallel.

For example, your application configures `Downloader`  with a `Concurrency` of `5`. Your application then
calls `Download` from two different goroutines, the result will be `10` concurrent part downloads
(2 goroutines * 5 `Concurrency`).

{{% pageinfo color="warning" %}}
Your application is expected to limit the concurrent calls to `Download` to prevent application resource exhaustion.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

For more information about `Downloader` and its other configuration options, see
[manager.Downloader]({{< apiref "feature/s3/manager/#Downloader" >}}) in the {{% alias sdk-api %}}.

### Overriding Downloader Options Per Download

You can override the `Downloader` options when calling `Download` by providing one or more functional arguments to the
method. These overrides are concurrency safe modifications and do not affect ongoing uploads, or subsequent `Download`
calls to the manager. For example, to override the `PartSize` configuration for a specific upload request:

```go
params := &s3.GetObjectInput{
	Bucket: aws.String("my-bucket"),
	Key:    aws.String("my-key"),
}
resp, err := downloader.Download(context.TODO(), targetWriter, params, func(u *manager.Downloader) {
	u.PartSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10 MiB
})
```

#### Examples

##### Download All Objects in a Bucket

The following example uses pagination to gather a list of objects from an {{% alias service=S3 %}}  bucket. Then it
downloads each object to a local file.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"

	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/feature/s3/manager"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3"
)

var (
	Bucket         = "MyBucket" // Download from this bucket
	Prefix         = "logs/"    // Using this key prefix
	LocalDirectory = "s3logs"   // Into this directory
)

func main() {
	cfg, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO())
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("error:", err)
	}

	client := s3.NewFromConfig(cfg)
	manager := manager.NewDownloader(client)

	paginator := s3.NewListObjectsV2Paginator(client, &s3.ListObjectsV2Input{
		Bucket: &Bucket,
		Prefix: &Prefix,
	})

	for paginator.HasMorePages() {
		page, err := paginator.NextPage(context.TODO())
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalln("error:", err)
		}
		for _, obj := range page.Contents {
			if err := downloadToFile(manager, LocalDirectory, Bucket, aws.ToString(obj.Key)); err != nil {
				log.Fatalln("error:", err)
			}
		}
	}
}

func downloadToFile(downloader *manager.Downloader, targetDirectory, bucket, key string) error {
	// Create the directories in the path
	file := filepath.Join(targetDirectory, key)
	if err := os.MkdirAll(filepath.Dir(file), 0775); err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// Set up the local file
	fd, err := os.Create(file)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer fd.Close()

	// Download the file using the AWS SDK for Go
	fmt.Printf("Downloading s3://%s/%s to %s...\n", bucket, key, file)
	_, err = downloader.Download(context.TODO(), fd, &s3.GetObjectInput{Bucket: &bucket, Key: &key})

	return err
}
```

## GetBucketRegion

The [GetBucketRegion]({{% apiref "feature/s3/manager#GetBucketRegion" %}}) is a utility function for determining the
AWS Region location of an {{% alias service=S3 %}} Bucket. `GetBucketRegion` takes an {{% alias service=S3 %}}
client and uses it to determine the location of the requested Bucket within the AWS Partition associated with the
client's configured Region.

For example to find the Region for the Bucket `my-bucket`:

```go
cfg, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO())
if err != nil {
	log.Println("error:", err)
	return
}

bucket := "my-bucket"
region, err := manager.GetBucketRegion(ctx, s3.NewFromConfig(cfg), bucket)
if err != nil {
	var bnf manager.BucketNotFound
	if errors.As(err, &bnf) {
		log.Printf("unable to find bucket %s's Region\n", bucket)
	} else {
		log.Println("error:", err)
	}
	return
}
fmt.Printf("Bucket %s is in %s region\n", bucket, region)
```

If `GetBucketRegion` is not able to resolve the location of a Bucket, the function returns a
[BucketNotFound]({{% apiref "feature/s3/manager#BucketNotFound" %}}) error type as shown in the example.


# Unseekable Streaming Input

For API operations like `PutObject` and `UploadPart`, the {{% alias service=S3 %}} client expects the value of the `Body` input parameter to implement the [io.Seeker](https://pkg.go.dev/io#Seeker) interface by default. The `io.Seeker` interface is used by the client to determine the length of the value to upload, and to compute payload hash for the [request signature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html). If the `Body` input parameter value does not implement `io.Seeker`, your application will receive an error.

```
operation error S3: PutObject, failed to compute payload hash: failed to seek
body to start, request stream is not seekable
```

You can change this behavior by modifying the operation method's [Middleware]({{< ref "docs/middleware" >}}) using functional options. The [WithAPIOptions](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3#WithAPIOptions) helper returns a functional option for zero or more middleware mutators. To disable the client computing the payload hash and use [Unsigned Payload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-header-based-auth.html) request signature add [v4.SwapComputePayloadSHA256ForUnsignedPayloadMiddleware]({{< apiref "aws/signer/v4#SwapComputePayloadSHA256ForUnsignedPayloadMiddleware" >}}).

```go
resp, err := client.PutObject(context.TODO(), &s3.PutObjectInput{
    Bucket: &bucketName,
    Key: &objectName,
    Body: bytes.NewBuffer([]byte(`example object!`)),
    ContentLength: 15, // length of body
}, s3.WithAPIOptions(
    v4.SwapComputePayloadSHA256ForUnsignedPayloadMiddleware,
))
```

{{% pageinfo color="warning" %}}
{{% alias service=S3 %}} requires the content length to be provided for all object's uploaded to a bucket. Since the `Body` input parameter does not implement `io.Seeker` interface the client will not be able to compute the `ContentLength` parameter for the request. The parameter must be provided by the application. The request will fail if the `ContentLength` parameter is not provided.

Use the SDK's [Amazon S3 Upload Manager]({{< ref "docs/sdk-utilities/s3#upload-manager" >}}) for uploads that are not seekable, and do not have a known length.
