In the {{% alias sdk-go %}}, a session is an object that contains configuration information for [service-clients]().
which you use to interact with AWS services. For example, sessions can include information about the region where
requests will be sent, which credentials to use, or additional request handlers. Whenever you create a service client,
you must specify a session. For more information about sessions, see the [config]({{% apiref config %}})
package in the {{% alias sdk-api %}}.

Sessions can be shared across all service clients that share the same base configuration. The session is built from the
SDK's default configuration and request handlers.

You should cache sessions when possible. This is because creating a new session loads all configuration values from the
environment and configuration files each time the session is created. Sharing the session value across all of your
service clients ensures the configuration is loaded the fewest number of times.

## Concurrency

Sessions are safe to use concurrently as long as the session isn't being modified. The SDK doesn't modify the session
once the session is created. Creating service clients concurrently from a shared session is safe.

## Sessions with a Shared Configuration File

Using the previous method, you can create sessions that load the additional configuration file only if
the `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG` environment variable is set. Alternatively you can explicitly create a session with a shared
configuration enabled. To do this, you can use `NewSessionWithOptions` to configure how the session is created. Using
the `NewSessionWithOptions` with `SharedConfigState` set to `SharedConfigEnable` will create the session as if the
`AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG` environment variable was set.

## Creating Sessions

When you create a `session`, you can pass in optional `aws.Config` values that override the default or that override
the current configuration values. This allows you to provide additional or case-based configuration as needed.

By default `NewSession` only loads credentials from the shared credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`). If
the `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG` environment variable is set to a truthy value, the session is created from the configuration
values from the shared configuration (`aws/config`) and shared credentials (`~/.aws/credentials`) files. See
[sessions-with-shared-config]() for more information.

Create a session with the default configuration and request handlers. The following example creates a session with
credentials, region, and profile values from either the environment variables, or the shared credentials file. It
requires that the `AWS_PROFILE` is set, or `default` is used.

```go
sess, err := session.NewSession()
```

The SDK provides a default configuration that all sessions use, unless you override a field. For example, you can
specify an AWS Region when you create a session by using the
``aws.Config`` struct. For more information about the fields you can specify, see the [aws.Config]({{< apiref "aws/#Config"
>}}) in the {{% alias sdk-api %}}.

```go
sess, err := session.NewSession(&aws.Config{ Region: aws.String("us-east-2")})
```

Create an {{% alias service=S3 %}} client instance from a session:

```go
sess, err := session.NewSession()
if err != nil {
    // Handle Session creation error
}
svc := s3.New(sess)
```

## Create Sessions with Option Overrides

In addition to ``NewSession``, you can create sessions using ``NewSessionWithOptions``. This function allows you to
control and override how the session will be created through code, instead of being driven by environment variables
only.

Use `NewSessionWithOptions>` when you want to provide the config profile, or override the shared credentials state
(AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG).

```go
// Equivalent to session.New
sess, err := session.NewSessionWithOptions(session.Options{})

// Specify profile to load for the session's config
sess, err := session.NewSessionWithOptions(session.Options{
    Profile: "profile_name",
})

// Specify profile for config and region for requests
sess, err := session.NewSessionWithOptions(session.Options{
Config: aws.Config{Region: aws.String("us-east-2")},
    Profile: "profile_name",
})

// Force enable Shared Config support
sess, err := session.NewSessionWithOptions(session.Options{
    SharedConfigState: SharedConfigEnable,
})

// Assume an IAM role with MFA prompting for token code on stdin
sess := session.Must(session.NewSessionWithOptions(session.Options{
    AssumeRoleTokenProvider: stscreds.StdinTokenProvider,
    SharedConfigState: SharedConfigEnable,
}))

```

## Shared Configuration Fields

By default, the SDK loads credentials from the shared credentials file
`~/.aws/credentials`. Any other configuration values are provided by the environment variables, SDK defaults, and
user-provided `aws.Config` values.

If the ``AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG`` environment variable is set, or the **SharedConfigEnable** option is used to create the
session (as shown in the following example), additional configuration information is also loaded from the shared
configuration file (`~/.aws/config`), if it exists. If any configuration setting value differs between the two files,
the value from the shared credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`) takes precedence.

```go
sess := session.Must(session.NewSessionWithOptions(session.Options{
    SharedConfigState: session.SharedConfigEnable,
}))
```

See the [session package's documentation]() for more information on shared credentials setup.

## Environment Variables

When a session is created, you can set several environment variables to adjust how the SDK functions, and what
configuration data it loads when creating sessions. Environment values are optional. For credentials, you must set both
an access key and a secret access key. Otherwise, Go ignores the one you've set. All environment variable values are
strings unless otherwise noted.

See the [session package's documentation]() for more information on environment variable setup.

## Adding Request Handlers

You can add handlers to a session for processing HTTP requests. All service clients that use the session inherit the
handlers. For example, the following handler logs every request and its payload made by a service client.

```go
// Create a session, and add additional handlers for all service
// clients created with the Session to inherit. Adds logging handler.
sess, err := session.NewSession()
sess.Handlers.Send.PushFront(func (r *request.Request) {
    // Log every request made and its payload
    logger.Println("Request: %s/%s, Payload: %s", r.ClientInfo.ServiceName, r.Operation, r.Params)
})
```

## Copying a Session

You can use the [Copy]() method to create copies of sessions. Copying sessions is useful when you want to create
multiple sessions that have similar settings. Each time you copy a session, you can specify different values for any 
field. For example, the following snippet copies the `sess` session while  overriding the `Region` field to
`us-east-2`:
```go
usEast2Sess := sess.Copy(&aws.Config{Region: aws.String("us-east-2")})
```
