Welcome to the AWS SDK for Go. The AWS SDK for Go provides APIs and utilities that developers can use to build Go
applications that use AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage
Service (Amazon S3).

The SDK removes the complexity of coding directly against a web service interface. It hides a lot of the lower-level
plumbing, such as authentication, request retries, and error handling.

The SDK also includes helpful utilities. For example, the Amazon S3 download and upload manager can automatically break
up large objects into multiple parts and transfer them in parallel.

Use the AWS SDK for Go Developer Guide to help you install, configure, and use the SDK. The guide provides configuration
information, sample code, and an introduction to the SDK utilities.
