The Amazon Web Services (AWS) global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones.

AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are connected with low-latency,
high-throughput, and highly redundant networking.

With Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically fail over between
Availability Zones without interruption. Availability Zones are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than
traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures.

For more information about AWS Regions and Availability Zones,
see [AWS Global Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/).

This AWS product or service follows
the [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model) through the specific
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
services it supports. For AWS service security information, see
the [AWS service security documentation page](https://aws.amazon.com/security/?id=docs_gateway#aws-security)
