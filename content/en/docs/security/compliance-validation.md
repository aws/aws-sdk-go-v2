This AWS product or service follows
the [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model) through the specific
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
services it supports.
For [AWS service security information](https://aws.amazon.com/security/?id=docs_gateway#aws-security), see the AWS
