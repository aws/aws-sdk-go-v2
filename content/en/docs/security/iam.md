AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) service that helps an administrator securely
control access to AWS resources. IAM administrators control who can be authenticated (signed in) and authorized (have
permissions) to use resources AWS services. IAM is an AWS service that you can use with no additional charge.

To use this AWS product or service to access AWS, you need an AWS account and AWS credentials. To increase the security
of your AWS account, we recommend that you use an IAM user to provide access credentials instead of using your AWS
account credentials.

For details about working with IAM, see [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/).

For an overview of IAM users and why they are important for the security of your account,
see [AWS Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html)
in the [Amazon Web Services General Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/).

This AWS product or service follows
